As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
1,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release
Credit Suisse expects to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 on April 27, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/agm-2022-invitation.html

3,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

6,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

10,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

13,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Award-winning actor, author and activist Michael J. Fox, who will explain why there’s ‘no time like the future’ to channel our energies towards building a life of resilience and hope.
Tennis champion, philanthropist and Credit Suisse Global Brand Ambassador Roger Federer, sharing how he has maintained a competitive edge throughout his incredible career.

Justin Yifu Lin, Honorary Dean, National School of Development, Peking University, Councilor of the State Council and member of the Standing Committee, Chinese People’s Political Consultation Conference, assessing China’s comparative advantages over the next decade.
Nicolas Aguzin, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, elaborating on the forces that will have the most influence over the next 25 years of investing in the region.
Mo Gawdat, author, Founder of One Billion Happy and former Chief Business Officer at Google X, covering how artificial intelligence will transform our world.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;
All things digital, including the metaverse; and

15,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

20,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Energy transition and China renewables, and what it means to transition to carbon neutrality.
Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;

24,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

26,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

28,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

31,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.

35,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release
Credit Suisse expects to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 on April 27, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/agm-2022-invitation.html
41,Decision by a Court in Bermuda,,Zurich,29.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group takes note of the Bermuda Supreme Court’s judgment against a local life insurance subsidiary of Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Life Bermuda, and refers to its press release of March 23, 2022.
The judgment relates to life insurance policies of one client of Credit Suisse Life Bermuda. The life insurance subsidiary has been closed to new business and in wind-down for more than seven years and has no other material business that will be affected by this judgment.
The judgment is not yet final and is subject to appeal, which Credit Suisse Life Bermuda intends to vigorously pursue.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/decision-court-bermuda.html
42,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

45,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;
All things digital, including the metaverse; and

49,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles.

On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

53,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
55,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

57,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

60,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.
These inspirational and keynote speakers include:
Award-winning actor, author and activist Michael J. Fox, who will explain why there’s ‘no time like the future’ to channel our energies towards building a life of resilience and hope.
Tennis champion, philanthropist and Credit Suisse Global Brand Ambassador Roger Federer, sharing how he has maintained a competitive edge throughout his incredible career.

64,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

68,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

70,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html

72,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

74,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

77,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;

81,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

85,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
88,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html
89,Credit Suisse Group appoints Axel P. Lehmann as new Chairman; António Horta-Osório has resigned,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,17.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group today announced that the Board of Directors (Board) has appointed Axel P. Lehmann as the bank’s new Chairman effective immediately. He succeeds António Horta-Osório, who resigned following an investigation commissioned by the Board. Under the leadership of Axel Lehmann, the Board and the Executive Board will continue to execute Credit Suisse’s strategy, driving forward the transformation of the bank.
  Mr. Horta-Osório said: “I have worked hard to return Credit Suisse to a successful course, and I am proud of what we have achieved together in my short time at the bank. Credit Suisse’s strategic realignment will provide for a clear focus on strengthening, simplifying and investing for growth. I am convinced that Credit Suisse is well positioned today and on the right track for the future. I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally. I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time. I wish my colleagues at Credit Suisse every success for the future.”
Severin Schwan, Vice-Chairman and Lead Independent Director of the Board of Credit Suisse, said: “We respect António’s decision and owe him considerable thanks for his leadership in defining the new strategy, which we will continue to implement over the coming months and years. Axel Lehmann as the new Chairman, with his extensive international and Swiss industry experience, is ideally suited to drive forward the strategic and cultural transformation of the bank. We wish Axel every success in his new role and António all the best for the future.”
Axel Lehmann in office as new Chairman
Following his appointment by the Board, Axel Lehmann has taken office as Chairman. The Board will also propose him for election as Chairman at the upcoming Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2022.
Axel Lehmann, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: “I would like to thank the Board for the trust it has placed in me and look forward to working even more closely with the Board and the Executive Board. We have set the right course with the new strategy and will continue to embed a stronger risk culture across the firm. By executing our strategic plan in a timely and disciplined manner, without distraction, I am convinced that Credit Suisse will demonstrate the renewed strength and business focus needed to generate sustainable value for all of our stakeholders.”
Axel Lehmann was elected as a member of the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group by the Extraordinary General Meeting held on October 1, 2021 and also became the Chair of the Risk Committee. He was formerly a member of the Group Executive Board of UBS Group, initially as Group Chief Operating Officer and then as President Personal & Corporate Banking and President UBS Switzerland. Between 2009 and 2015, Mr. Lehmann served as a non-executive director and a member of the Risk Committee of UBS Group and was a member of the Governance and Nominating Committee from 2011 to 2013.
His career at Zurich Insurance Group spanned almost 20 years, nearly 14 of which were as a member of the Group Executive Committee in various roles. These include responsibility for the insurer’s European and North America business, group IT and as Chief Risk Officer.
Mr. Lehmann currently holds mandates at several academic and non-profit institutions, including serving as an adjunct professor at the University of St. Gallen. He holds a PhD in Business Administration from the University of St. Gallen and is a graduate of the Advanced Management Program of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, USA.

As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
92,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release

The judgment relates to life insurance policies of one client of Credit Suisse Life Bermuda. The life insurance subsidiary has been closed to new business and in wind-down for more than seven years and has no other material business that will be affected by this judgment.

94,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

97,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.
These inspirational and keynote speakers include:
Award-winning actor, author and activist Michael J. Fox, who will explain why there’s ‘no time like the future’ to channel our energies towards building a life of resilience and hope.
Tennis champion, philanthropist and Credit Suisse Global Brand Ambassador Roger Federer, sharing how he has maintained a competitive edge throughout his incredible career.
Dr Condoleezza Rice, US Secretary of State (2005-2009), providing her unique perspective on how the recent geopolitical developments may unfold and what role international capital will play in influencing the outcome.

Nicolas Aguzin, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, elaborating on the forces that will have the most influence over the next 25 years of investing in the region.
Mo Gawdat, author, Founder of One Billion Happy and former Chief Business Officer at Google X, covering how artificial intelligence will transform our world.

101,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

104,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

106,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
107,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

  Mr. Horta-Osório said: “I have worked hard to return Credit Suisse to a successful course, and I am proud of what we have achieved together in my short time at the bank. Credit Suisse’s strategic realignment will provide for a clear focus on strengthening, simplifying and investing for growth. I am convinced that Credit Suisse is well positioned today and on the right track for the future. I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally. I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time. I wish my colleagues at Credit Suisse every success for the future.”
Severin Schwan, Vice-Chairman and Lead Independent Director of the Board of Credit Suisse, said: “We respect António’s decision and owe him considerable thanks for his leadership in defining the new strategy, which we will continue to implement over the coming months and years.

113,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

115,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

118,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.

122,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction.

On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

126,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

128,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
129,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

The call settlement date for REML is expected to be December 27, 2021, and the acceleration dates for FLGE and FEUL are expected to be December 23, 2021 and December 22, 2021, respectively. As of today, Credit Suisse will no longer issue new units of these ETNs.",New York,10.12.2021,"As described in the related pricing supplements for REML (the ""REML Pricing Supplement""), FLGE (the ""FLGE Pricing Supplement"") and FEUL (the ""FEUL Pricing Supplement""), Credit Suisse, as the issuer of REML, FLGE and FEUL (together, the ""ETNs""), may, at its option, call or accelerate, as applicable, all issued and outstanding units of the ETNs. Credit Suisse has exercised this right by delivering a notice of issuer optional call and optional acceleration via the Depository Trust Company on December 10, 2021.
The call settlement date for REML is expected to be December 27, 2021.

138,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

140,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

143,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;
All things digital, including the metaverse; and

147,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

""By bringing together complementary expertise, Credit Suisse and RavenPack have provided an objective and quantitative approach to information gathering and we are proud of this collaborative success Not only has the index recorded a 6.7% annualized performance* since its launch in 2017, but it also has offered a window into the attractiveness of asset allocations systematically selected by sophisticated data-driven analysis"" says Mike Heraty, Head of Institutional Solutions at Credit Suisse.

151,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

153,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
154,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review.

I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time. I wish my colleagues at Credit Suisse every success for the future.”
Severin Schwan, Vice-Chairman and Lead Independent Director of the Board of Credit Suisse, said: “We respect António’s decision and owe him considerable thanks for his leadership in defining the new strategy, which we will continue to implement over the coming months and years.

We have set the right course with the new strategy and will continue to embed a stronger risk culture across the firm. By executing our strategic plan in a timely and disciplined manner, without distraction, I am convinced that Credit Suisse will demonstrate the renewed strength and business focus needed to generate sustainable value for all of our stakeholders.”

Credit Suisse has exercised this right by delivering a notice of issuer optional call and optional acceleration via the Depository Trust Company on December 10, 2021.
The call settlement date for REML is expected to be December 27, 2021.

As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
163,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release
Credit Suisse expects to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 on April 27, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/agm-2022-invitation.html
164,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

167,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Yat Siu, Chairman of Animoca brands, speaking about the future of gaming environments.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;

171,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

""By bringing together complementary expertise, Credit Suisse and RavenPack have provided an objective and quantitative approach to information gathering and we are proud of this collaborative success Not only has the index recorded a 6.7% annualized performance* since its launch in 2017, but it also has offered a window into the attractiveness of asset allocations systematically selected by sophisticated data-driven analysis"" says Mike Heraty, Head of Institutional Solutions at Credit Suisse.

175,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

177,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
178,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
188,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

190,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

193,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.
These inspirational and keynote speakers include:

197,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

""By bringing together complementary expertise, Credit Suisse and RavenPack have provided an objective and quantitative approach to information gathering and we are proud of this collaborative success Not only has the index recorded a 6.7% annualized performance* since its launch in 2017, but it also has offered a window into the attractiveness of asset allocations systematically selected by sophisticated data-driven analysis"" says Mike Heraty, Head of Institutional Solutions at Credit Suisse.

201,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

203,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
204,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

214,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
217,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

219,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

222,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;

226,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

""By bringing together complementary expertise, Credit Suisse and RavenPack have provided an objective and quantitative approach to information gathering and we are proud of this collaborative success Not only has the index recorded a 6.7% annualized performance* since its launch in 2017, but it also has offered a window into the attractiveness of asset allocations systematically selected by sophisticated data-driven analysis"" says Mike Heraty, Head of Institutional Solutions at Credit Suisse.

230,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

232,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
233,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

243,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

245,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

249,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

251,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

254,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;

258,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

262,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html

Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

275,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

277,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

281,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release
Credit Suisse expects to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 on April 27, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/agm-2022-invitation.html
282,Decision by a Court in Bermuda,,Zurich,29.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group takes note of the Bermuda Supreme Court’s judgment against a local life insurance subsidiary of Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Life Bermuda, and refers to its press release of March 23, 2022.
The judgment relates to life insurance policies of one client of Credit Suisse Life Bermuda. The life insurance subsidiary has been closed to new business and in wind-down for more than seven years and has no other material business that will be affected by this judgment.
The judgment is not yet final and is subject to appeal, which Credit Suisse Life Bermuda intends to vigorously pursue.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/decision-court-bermuda.html
283,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.

The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;
All things digital, including the metaverse; and

290,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction.

On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene.

294,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
297,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

307,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

His track record in building and maintaining a leading Internal Audit team, in transforming and innovating its operating model as well as in building a strong bench of audit leaders has contributed to the stature of the function.

Both Christine and Rafael will join the Executive Board effective by February 1, 2022 at the latest, and October 1, 2021, respectively, reporting directly to the Group Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Gottstein.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman, and Thomas Gottstein, Group CEO commented on the appointments: ""We congratulate Christine and Rafael on their new roles.

These two appointments reflect the talent in Credit Suisse and the diversity of backgrounds and experience in our bank.  They will both contribute to shaping and implementing the strategy of the bank going forward.  We would like to specifically thank Antoinette for her invaluable contributions as a leader, which deserves particular recognition. She has provided exceptional support to the bank for 18 years in various positions and through challenging times. We would also like to thank Thomas for taking on the role of interim Global Head of Compliance in these challenging conditions.""
Since 2013, prior to joining Credit Suisse, Ms. Graeff was the Director General of Communications at the European Central Bank.

314,Credit Suisse publishes answers to Ethos Foundation information request,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,04.04.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the answers provided to Ethos Foundation and other shareholders following an information request concerning the supply chain finance funds and the ""Suisse Secrets"" (also referred to as ""Swiss Leaks"") matters.
As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
315,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release
Credit Suisse expects to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 on April 27, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/agm-2022-invitation.html
316,Decision by a Court in Bermuda,,Zurich,29.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group takes note of the Bermuda Supreme Court’s judgment against a local life insurance subsidiary of Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Life Bermuda, and refers to its press release of March 23, 2022.
The judgment relates to life insurance policies of one client of Credit Suisse Life Bermuda. The life insurance subsidiary has been closed to new business and in wind-down for more than seven years and has no other material business that will be affected by this judgment.

317,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

320,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.
These inspirational and keynote speakers include:
Award-winning actor, author and activist Michael J. Fox, who will explain why there’s ‘no time like the future’ to channel our energies towards building a life of resilience and hope.
Tennis champion, philanthropist and Credit Suisse Global Brand Ambassador Roger Federer, sharing how he has maintained a competitive edge throughout his incredible career.
Dr Condoleezza Rice, US Secretary of State (2005-2009), providing her unique perspective on how the recent geopolitical developments may unfold and what role international capital will play in influencing the outcome.

324,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

""By bringing together complementary expertise, Credit Suisse and RavenPack have provided an objective and quantitative approach to information gathering and we are proud of this collaborative success Not only has the index recorded a 6.7% annualized performance* since its launch in 2017, but it also has offered a window into the attractiveness of asset allocations systematically selected by sophisticated data-driven analysis"" says Mike Heraty, Head of Institutional Solutions at Credit Suisse.

328,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

330,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
331,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

341,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

343,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

353,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release
Credit Suisse expects to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 on April 27, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/agm-2022-invitation.html
354,Decision by a Court in Bermuda,,Zurich,29.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group takes note of the Bermuda Supreme Court’s judgment against a local life insurance subsidiary of Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Life Bermuda, and refers to its press release of March 23, 2022.
The judgment relates to life insurance policies of one client of Credit Suisse Life Bermuda. The life insurance subsidiary has been closed to new business and in wind-down for more than seven years and has no other material business that will be affected by this judgment.
The judgment is not yet final and is subject to appeal, which Credit Suisse Life Bermuda intends to vigorously pursue.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/decision-court-bermuda.html
355,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

358,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.

362,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

366,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
369,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

379,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

381,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

Lehmann and Juan Colombas for election as new non-executive members of the Board at such EGM to be held on October 1, 2021.

390,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

At the same time, I would like to thank Joachim for accepting to perform the role as ad interim Chief Risk Officer in early April when the bank needed his experience and technical knowhow. Joachim was instrumental in leading the various risk-mitigation initiatives over the past few challenging months and we are fortunate to be able to continue to count on his leadership during the coming months until David joins us and thereafter.""

The appointment is with immediate effect.",Hong Kong,09.07.2021,"Carsten Stoehr, CEO of Greater China at Credit Suisse, said: “China is a strategically important market for Credit Suisse, both in the Asia Pacific region and globally. We firmly believe in the long term prospects for China with its continued liberalization, and are committed to investing in this important market. Our aim is to bring the best of Credit Suisse’s integrated advisory services and solutions to clients in China, leveraging our global platform and our position as a leading global wealth manager with strong investment banking capabilities.”
As part of the next phase of our strategy, Ms. Hu, in her new role as CEO of China, will continue to drive our onshore business and regulatory activities with the objectives to further increase our presence, set up a comprehensive platform, and enhance Credit Suisse’s position. She will work closely with Credit Suisse’s leadership team across Asia Pacific and Greater China to capitalize on collaboration opportunities.
Ms. Hu has an outstanding professional track-record, with over 25 years of experience in the financial markets in China. During her 20-year tenure at Credit Suisse, she has held various senior roles across our China franchise, including Vice Chairwoman of Credit Suisse China and Head of China Investment Banking. In her capacity as Vice Chairwoman of China, Ms. Hu was instrumental in Credit Suisse becoming a majority shareholder of our China securities joint venture in June 2020.
Last week, Credit Suisse renamed its China securities joint venture as Credit Suisse Securities (China) Limited, marking another major step in the bank’s ongoing build-out of its China franchise. Over the past year in mainland China, Credit Suisse has recruited more than 60 professionals across all businesses and corporate functions.
The appointment of Mr. Hu follows the departure of Zhenyi Tang, who is leaving Credit Suisse to pursue other opportunities outside the financial services sector.
Credit Suisse in China
Credit Suisse’s journey in China began more than 60 years ago when it started a correspondent banking relationship with the Bank of China in the 1950s. Credit Suisse was the first Swiss bank to open a representative office in Beijing in 1985, and subsequently opened its Shanghai Bank Branch. Over the years, Credit Suisse has built a strong Greater China business, with a market-leading franchise across private banking, equities, and investment banking and capital markets.
In addition to the securities joint venture, Credit Suisse has an asset management joint venture – ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management Co. Ltd. – which is among the largest in China, with total assets under management of nearly RMB 1.4 trillion as of the end of December 2020.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/07/en/credit-suisse-appoints-janice-hu-ceo-china.html

394,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

396,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

399,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;
All things digital, including the metaverse; and

403,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

407,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

410,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

420,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

422,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

428,Proposed new appointments to the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,13.08.2021,"The Board of Directors (Board) of Credit Suisse Group AG is calling an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) and proposing Axel P. Lehmann and Juan Colombas for election as new non-executive members of the Board at such EGM to be held on October 1, 2021.
The Board of Credit Suisse announced today the nomination of Axel Lehmann and Juan Colombas for election to the Board at an EGM of Credit Suisse Group AG to be held on October 1, 2021.

With their deep experience in risk management and business leadership, and both with careers spanning approximately three decades in financial services, they will make an invaluable contribution as we shape the bank’s strategic realignment and enhance our culture of risk management and personal responsibility and accountability.

431,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

Over the years, Credit Suisse has built a strong Greater China business, with a market-leading franchise across private banking, equities, and investment banking and capital markets.

438,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

440,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

443,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;

447,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

451,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

454,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

464,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

466,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

472,Proposed new appointments to the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,13.08.2021,"The Board of Directors (Board) of Credit Suisse Group AG is calling an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) and proposing Axel P.

475,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

483,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
485,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release
Credit Suisse expects to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 on April 27, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/agm-2022-invitation.html
486,Decision by a Court in Bermuda,,Zurich,29.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group takes note of the Bermuda Supreme Court’s judgment against a local life insurance subsidiary of Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Life Bermuda, and refers to its press release of March 23, 2022.
The judgment relates to life insurance policies of one client of Credit Suisse Life Bermuda. The life insurance subsidiary has been closed to new business and in wind-down for more than seven years and has no other material business that will be affected by this judgment.
The judgment is not yet final and is subject to appeal, which Credit Suisse Life Bermuda intends to vigorously pursue.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/decision-court-bermuda.html
487,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

490,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;
All things digital, including the metaverse; and

While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

498,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""

We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
501,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

511,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

513,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

522,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

530,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

532,Credit Suisse research shows global food inequality and waste costs up to US$13.6 trillion annually,,London,08.06.2021,"Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) published a new research report entitled ‘The global food system: Identifying sustainable solutions’, the first under new Chairman António Horta-Osório. The report examines the discrepancy in food production and waste and highlights potential solutions to reduce the estimated US$13.6 trillion annual cost.
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the global eco-system. However, at present almost 700 million people are undernourished while 40% of the world’s adult population is overweight or obese. Some studies suggest that 20% of total deaths among adults can be attributed to dietary risks. Food production, and importantly consumption, needs to change significantly in order to address these challenges. Roadblocks that need to be overcome include the need for tighter regulation and a review of the global agricultural sector.
Food production and consumption has a major environmental impact
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% of the world’s freshwater consumption (see also: Water scarcity: addressing the key challenges). The analysis suggest that the environmental footprint of the global food system is likely to worsen significantly during the next few decades unless action is taken. The likely growth in the world’s population to c10 billion by 2050 coupled with a further shift in diets, especially across the expanding emerging middle class, could increase food-related emissions by a further 46% while demand for agricultural land could increase by 49%. This is incompatible with the need to achieve a net-zero emission environment globally by 2050.
Food loss and waste needs to be addressed
The challenges associated with malnutrition and the environmental footprint could partly be addressed by targeting food loss and waste. More than 30% of food produced is either lost or wasted which meant that in 2019 cUS$408 billion of produced food went unsold or uneaten. The combined economic, environmental and social cost associated with food waste is estimated at US$2.6 trillion by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Eliminating food waste in the US and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as c50% of food loss and waste occurs during the production and handling phase while 45% takes place in the distribution and consumption phase.
Who’s most at risk from food sustainability?
The simultaneous existence of undernourishment, obesity, the environmental footprint of food production and food waste puts the global food system under significant stress. However, these factors do not impact all countries in the same way suggesting that different solutions or strategies are needed for different countries. Using the Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, we find that France, the Netherlands and Canada score best while sustainability is lowest in Russia, Bulgaria and the UAE. Sustainability challenges differ between regions: developed countries score worse on diet patterns and food waste whereas emerging countries need to address food loss and general life quality.
A change in diet is required
A change in diet towards one that is plant-based appears inevitable if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research suggest that a plant-based diet not only has a c90% lower emission intensity than that of a current average diet but that it also has the potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults by c11million. There is strong growth potential for alternative animal-protein products and the report estimates that the market for alternative meat and dairy can grow from a current size of cUS$14 billion to US$1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite the involvement of more than 600 largely small and private companies in this field, the authors expect the traditional food companies to play a key role as they steadily transition their operations towards healthier and alternative food products.
Agriculture needs to go digital
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending power and declining arable land per capita suggest that a shift in diet alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large scale adoption of new technologies. The report highlights more than 70 including vertical farming and precision agricultural solutions.
Sharing, circular-solutions, packaging and cooling help address food loss and waste
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste to create new (food) products help too. Smart packaging solutions are being developed that not only help improve production yields but importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply chain from farm to the home. The development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food even more.
Eugène Klerk, Head of Global ESG & Thematic Research at Credit Suisse, said: “New technologies will need to accompany behavioral change. A shift in diet alone will not be enough in itself to make the food system wholly sustainable. Our report thus highlights an array of technological solutions that have the potential to improve productivity, expand the product offer and crucially reduce waste. In addition, it showcases innovative companies and their pioneering technologies designed to meet the challenge.”
Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, commented: “Sustainability is a risk that companies must adequately and proactively manage. And, as other sectors before it, the food industry is going to be increasingly scrutinized by investors, consumers and regulators, pushing it to focus more on sustainable and above all, healthy food. There could be material liability risks down the road otherwise. There are also likely beneficiaries from this transition, including technology companies providing “smart-agricultural” solutions, vertical and precision farming to meet urban food demand and provide productivity yields, companies who use circular-based or smart-packaging solutions and the development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions that help extend the lifespan of food even more. But ultimately, it is really about people living a longer and more healthy life altogether, and I am convinced that investors play a significant role in catalyzing these emerging trends in how they deploy their capital.”",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/06/en/credit-suisse-research-shows-global-food-inequality-and-waste-co.html

534,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

536,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

539,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;
All things digital, including the metaverse; and

543,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

""By bringing together complementary expertise, Credit Suisse and RavenPack have provided an objective and quantitative approach to information gathering and we are proud of this collaborative success Not only has the index recorded a 6.7% annualized performance* since its launch in 2017, but it also has offered a window into the attractiveness of asset allocations systematically selected by sophisticated data-driven analysis"" says Mike Heraty, Head of Institutional Solutions at Credit Suisse.

547,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

549,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
550,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

560,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

562,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

571,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

579,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

581,Credit Suisse research shows global food inequality and waste costs up to US$13.6 trillion annually,,London,08.06.2021,"Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) published a new research report entitled ‘The global food system: Identifying sustainable solutions’, the first under new Chairman António Horta-Osório. The report examines the discrepancy in food production and waste and highlights potential solutions to reduce the estimated US$13.6 trillion annual cost.
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the global eco-system. However, at present almost 700 million people are undernourished while 40% of the world’s adult population is overweight or obese. Some studies suggest that 20% of total deaths among adults can be attributed to dietary risks. Food production, and importantly consumption, needs to change significantly in order to address these challenges. Roadblocks that need to be overcome include the need for tighter regulation and a review of the global agricultural sector.
Food production and consumption has a major environmental impact
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% of the world’s freshwater consumption (see also: Water scarcity: addressing the key challenges). The analysis suggest that the environmental footprint of the global food system is likely to worsen significantly during the next few decades unless action is taken. The likely growth in the world’s population to c10 billion by 2050 coupled with a further shift in diets, especially across the expanding emerging middle class, could increase food-related emissions by a further 46% while demand for agricultural land could increase by 49%. This is incompatible with the need to achieve a net-zero emission environment globally by 2050.
Food loss and waste needs to be addressed
The challenges associated with malnutrition and the environmental footprint could partly be addressed by targeting food loss and waste. More than 30% of food produced is either lost or wasted which meant that in 2019 cUS$408 billion of produced food went unsold or uneaten. The combined economic, environmental and social cost associated with food waste is estimated at US$2.6 trillion by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Eliminating food waste in the US and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as c50% of food loss and waste occurs during the production and handling phase while 45% takes place in the distribution and consumption phase.
Who’s most at risk from food sustainability?
The simultaneous existence of undernourishment, obesity, the environmental footprint of food production and food waste puts the global food system under significant stress. However, these factors do not impact all countries in the same way suggesting that different solutions or strategies are needed for different countries. Using the Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, we find that France, the Netherlands and Canada score best while sustainability is lowest in Russia, Bulgaria and the UAE. Sustainability challenges differ between regions: developed countries score worse on diet patterns and food waste whereas emerging countries need to address food loss and general life quality.
A change in diet is required
A change in diet towards one that is plant-based appears inevitable if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research suggest that a plant-based diet not only has a c90% lower emission intensity than that of a current average diet but that it also has the potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults by c11million. There is strong growth potential for alternative animal-protein products and the report estimates that the market for alternative meat and dairy can grow from a current size of cUS$14 billion to US$1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite the involvement of more than 600 largely small and private companies in this field, the authors expect the traditional food companies to play a key role as they steadily transition their operations towards healthier and alternative food products.
Agriculture needs to go digital
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending power and declining arable land per capita suggest that a shift in diet alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large scale adoption of new technologies. The report highlights more than 70 including vertical farming and precision agricultural solutions.
Sharing, circular-solutions, packaging and cooling help address food loss and waste
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste to create new (food) products help too. Smart packaging solutions are being developed that not only help improve production yields but importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply chain from farm to the home. The development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food even more.
Eugène Klerk, Head of Global ESG & Thematic Research at Credit Suisse, said: “New technologies will need to accompany behavioral change. A shift in diet alone will not be enough in itself to make the food system wholly sustainable. Our report thus highlights an array of technological solutions that have the potential to improve productivity, expand the product offer and crucially reduce waste. In addition, it showcases innovative companies and their pioneering technologies designed to meet the challenge.”
Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, commented: “Sustainability is a risk that companies must adequately and proactively manage. And, as other sectors before it, the food industry is going to be increasingly scrutinized by investors, consumers and regulators, pushing it to focus more on sustainable and above all, healthy food. There could be material liability risks down the road otherwise. There are also likely beneficiaries from this transition, including technology companies providing “smart-agricultural” solutions, vertical and precision farming to meet urban food demand and provide productivity yields, companies who use circular-based or smart-packaging solutions and the development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions that help extend the lifespan of food even more. But ultimately, it is really about people living a longer and more healthy life altogether, and I am convinced that investors play a significant role in catalyzing these emerging trends in how they deploy their capital.”",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/06/en/credit-suisse-research-shows-global-food-inequality-and-waste-co.html
582,Credit Suisse Americas Foundation Makes a Commitment to Wake Tech,"Raleigh, NC, May 26, 2021 – Credit Suisse, one of the world's leading financial services providers, has announced a $250,000 commitment through its Credit Suisse Americas Foundation (CSAF) to support Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech).",New York,26.05.2021,"Wake Tech is the largest community college in North Carolina. It serves more than 70,000 adults each year across six campuses and three training centers, in addition to community sites and online learning options. Credit Suisse's grant will support the college's WakeWorks® Apprenticeship program, which offers strategic pathways to future workforce opportunities by enabling young people to learn new skills, gain access to employers, and earn credentials and income while doing so. The financial support will help the program to expand beyond its existing employer-sponsored model to offer young people from the local community the opportunity to secure an apprenticeship at a broader set of employers.
This investment is part of Credit Suisse's philanthropic commitment to Future Skills, which aims to equip young people with the skills and education needed to gain meaningful employment and fulfill their potential. While continuing to partner with organizations that prioritize college completion, we are also investing in additional pathways that enable strong career starts and upward mobility. This includes career integration into K-12 and post-secondary education along with quality two-year degrees, certifications and apprenticeships. This donation continues a multi-decade commitment by the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation to empower underrepresented young people.

583,Credit Suisse sees strong future for domestic Chinese consumer brands,"The policy of ""Dual Circulation"", which will guide China's economic development for years to come, has driven an upsurge in domestic demand for Chinese consumer brands, according to Credit Suisse Securities Research analysts presenting at the 8th annual China A- Shares Conference.",Hong Kong,25.05.2021,"The Credit Suisse 8th China A-Shares Conference, taking place online from May 11-13, 2021, provides a platform for investors to explore the emerging trends in one of the world's largest and most dynamic stock markets. Participating in this year's conference are more than 70 leading A-share listed companies spanning 12 sectors including technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, industrials and autos and representing a total market capitalization of over RMB 9,147bn (USD 1,412.8bn).
Edmond Huang, Head of China/Hong Kong Securities Research, Credit Suisse, described ""Dual Circulation"" as a strategic choice to rebalance the Chinese economy away from an overreliance on external demand, provide a catalyst for unleashing domestic demand and achieve more sustainable development.
""On the supply side, China will step up technological innovation to move along the global value chain. On the demand side, it aims to boost household incomes to stimulate domestic demand,"" Mr. Huang said.
The global pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions have been two principal drivers of the ""Dual Circulation"" strategy, an inversion of China's previous strategy of globalization and trade-led growth.
The contribution to the Chinese economy from net exports is no longer as significant as it was 20 years ago, while the ageing population and growing wallets of Chinese consumers have also been a significant contributor to this new economic development model.
""Chinese brands have made remarkable progress in upgrading the quality of their products, with better aesthetics, innovation, and technology enhancements contributing to their overall enhanced appeal. They also have advantages in being able to adapt their products faster to changing consumer sentiment,"" Mr. Huang added.
This has, in turn, driven a strong sense of national pride in Chinese brands from domestic consumers. The phenomenon, known as ""China Pride"", is manifesting itself particularly for products such as sportswear, cosmetics, mobile phones and electric vehicles.
""Confidence in Chinese brands has been slowly growing for a number of years, but it accelerated through the pandemic,"" said Lei Chen, China consumer analyst with Credit Suisse's China Quantitative Insight (CQi). ""The improved product quality, marketing and distribution strategy, in addition to an increasing skepticism towards imported goods, especially foodstuffs, during Covid, have contributed to the rise of homegrown labels in China,"" Ms. Chen continued.
While the ""China Pride"" phenomenon is more pronounced among a younger generation that is largely wealthier than their parents were at the same stage in their lives, those younger consumers are also making luxury purchases earlier. This is one of the reasons why Credit Suisse analysts view this phenomenon as a long term trend for investors.
""Younger consumers are spending money earlier and are a key aspect of this ""China Pride"" idea that will become increasingly more meaningful as they mature into the next generation of older shoppers,"" Ms. Chen said.
Credit Suisse analysts expect those sectors hit hardest by Covid-19 in 2020, such travel, entertainment, cinemas and restaurants, to make a resurgence. In particular, the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 will boost sportswear and ""health conscious"" spending. But in general, Credit Suisse's analysts see this highly identifiable phenomenon of ""China Pride"" across the board – in infant formula, cosmetics and technology items, as well as in areas such as new energy vehicles and automobiles.
Sectors to watch
In the auto sector, China is expected to reduce its reliance on imported goods such as high-end luxury cars, pushing Chinese auto makers to establish high-end domestic auto brands that leverage the country's leadership in new energy and intelligent vehicle technologies, according to Bin Wang, Co- Head of APAC Autos Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
China's dominant position in electric vehicles is gathering pace, fomented by a rapidly evolving support sector. Battery prices continue to decline. Concurrently, the infrastructure to support electric vehicles, such as charging stations, are proliferating, while the rise of new entrants creates greater choices at different price points for domestic consumers.
""For the first quarter of 2021, Chinese local brands' new energy vehicles (NEV) accounted for 75.5% of total China NEV sales volume, reflecting consumer preference for Chinese branded vehicles,"" Mr. Wang said.
In the consumer sector, strong digital and marketing capabilities as well as a nimbleness to respond to consumers' changing needs, have led to strong momentum for domestic brands in sportswear, color cosmetics, skincare and infant milk formula, which have the potential to further increase market share.
Another factor contributing to ""China Pride"" as a long-term investment trend is that despite strong growth in the aforementioned sectors, Chinese brands are still underpenetrated when compared with the overall size of the market, with room for upside, according to Jesalyn Wong, China Consumer Analyst, Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
Strong and broad research coverage capabilities
Credit Suisse has one of the most comprehensive and highly recognized China Research coverage capabilities. The Credit Suisse Equity Research team covers more than 460 Chinese-listed stocks, including about 216 domestic A-shares, which represent over 70% of the CSI-300 index constituents by market capitalization. In addition, the HOLT platform covers close to 2,100 A-share companies and more than 3,000 stocks across Hong Kong and mainland China.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/05/en/credit-suisse-sees-strong-future-for-domestic-chinese-consumer-brands.html

As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
585,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

587,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;

594,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

""By bringing together complementary expertise, Credit Suisse and RavenPack have provided an objective and quantitative approach to information gathering and we are proud of this collaborative success Not only has the index recorded a 6.7% annualized performance* since its launch in 2017, but it also has offered a window into the attractiveness of asset allocations systematically selected by sophisticated data-driven analysis"" says Mike Heraty, Head of Institutional Solutions at Credit Suisse.

598,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
601,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

611,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

613,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

622,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

630,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

632,Credit Suisse research shows global food inequality and waste costs up to US$13.6 trillion annually,,London,08.06.2021,"Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) published a new research report entitled ‘The global food system: Identifying sustainable solutions’, the first under new Chairman António Horta-Osório. The report examines the discrepancy in food production and waste and highlights potential solutions to reduce the estimated US$13.6 trillion annual cost.
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the global eco-system. However, at present almost 700 million people are undernourished while 40% of the world’s adult population is overweight or obese. Some studies suggest that 20% of total deaths among adults can be attributed to dietary risks. Food production, and importantly consumption, needs to change significantly in order to address these challenges. Roadblocks that need to be overcome include the need for tighter regulation and a review of the global agricultural sector.
Food production and consumption has a major environmental impact
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% of the world’s freshwater consumption (see also: Water scarcity: addressing the key challenges). The analysis suggest that the environmental footprint of the global food system is likely to worsen significantly during the next few decades unless action is taken. The likely growth in the world’s population to c10 billion by 2050 coupled with a further shift in diets, especially across the expanding emerging middle class, could increase food-related emissions by a further 46% while demand for agricultural land could increase by 49%. This is incompatible with the need to achieve a net-zero emission environment globally by 2050.
Food loss and waste needs to be addressed
The challenges associated with malnutrition and the environmental footprint could partly be addressed by targeting food loss and waste. More than 30% of food produced is either lost or wasted which meant that in 2019 cUS$408 billion of produced food went unsold or uneaten. The combined economic, environmental and social cost associated with food waste is estimated at US$2.6 trillion by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Eliminating food waste in the US and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as c50% of food loss and waste occurs during the production and handling phase while 45% takes place in the distribution and consumption phase.
Who’s most at risk from food sustainability?
The simultaneous existence of undernourishment, obesity, the environmental footprint of food production and food waste puts the global food system under significant stress. However, these factors do not impact all countries in the same way suggesting that different solutions or strategies are needed for different countries. Using the Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, we find that France, the Netherlands and Canada score best while sustainability is lowest in Russia, Bulgaria and the UAE. Sustainability challenges differ between regions: developed countries score worse on diet patterns and food waste whereas emerging countries need to address food loss and general life quality.
A change in diet is required
A change in diet towards one that is plant-based appears inevitable if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research suggest that a plant-based diet not only has a c90% lower emission intensity than that of a current average diet but that it also has the potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults by c11million. There is strong growth potential for alternative animal-protein products and the report estimates that the market for alternative meat and dairy can grow from a current size of cUS$14 billion to US$1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite the involvement of more than 600 largely small and private companies in this field, the authors expect the traditional food companies to play a key role as they steadily transition their operations towards healthier and alternative food products.
Agriculture needs to go digital
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending power and declining arable land per capita suggest that a shift in diet alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large scale adoption of new technologies. The report highlights more than 70 including vertical farming and precision agricultural solutions.
Sharing, circular-solutions, packaging and cooling help address food loss and waste
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste to create new (food) products help too. Smart packaging solutions are being developed that not only help improve production yields but importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply chain from farm to the home. The development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food even more.
Eugène Klerk, Head of Global ESG & Thematic Research at Credit Suisse, said: “New technologies will need to accompany behavioral change. A shift in diet alone will not be enough in itself to make the food system wholly sustainable. Our report thus highlights an array of technological solutions that have the potential to improve productivity, expand the product offer and crucially reduce waste. In addition, it showcases innovative companies and their pioneering technologies designed to meet the challenge.”
Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, commented: “Sustainability is a risk that companies must adequately and proactively manage. And, as other sectors before it, the food industry is going to be increasingly scrutinized by investors, consumers and regulators, pushing it to focus more on sustainable and above all, healthy food. There could be material liability risks down the road otherwise. There are also likely beneficiaries from this transition, including technology companies providing “smart-agricultural” solutions, vertical and precision farming to meet urban food demand and provide productivity yields, companies who use circular-based or smart-packaging solutions and the development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions that help extend the lifespan of food even more. But ultimately, it is really about people living a longer and more healthy life altogether, and I am convinced that investors play a significant role in catalyzing these emerging trends in how they deploy their capital.”",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/06/en/credit-suisse-research-shows-global-food-inequality-and-waste-co.html

Participating in this year's conference are more than 70 leading A-share listed companies spanning 12 sectors including technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, industrials and autos and representing a total market capitalization of over RMB 9,147bn (USD 1,412.8bn).
Edmond Huang, Head of China/Hong Kong Securities Research, Credit Suisse, described ""Dual Circulation"" as a strategic choice to rebalance the Chinese economy away from an overreliance on external demand, provide a catalyst for unleashing domestic demand and achieve more sustainable development.
""On the supply side, China will step up technological innovation to move along the global value chain. On the demand side, it aims to boost household incomes to stimulate domestic demand,"" Mr. Huang said.
The global pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions have been two principal drivers of the ""Dual Circulation"" strategy, an inversion of China's previous strategy of globalization and trade-led growth.
The contribution to the Chinese economy from net exports is no longer as significant as it was 20 years ago, while the ageing population and growing wallets of Chinese consumers have also been a significant contributor to this new economic development model.
""Chinese brands have made remarkable progress in upgrading the quality of their products, with better aesthetics, innovation, and technology enhancements contributing to their overall enhanced appeal. They also have advantages in being able to adapt their products faster to changing consumer sentiment,"" Mr. Huang added.
This has, in turn, driven a strong sense of national pride in Chinese brands from domestic consumers. The phenomenon, known as ""China Pride"", is manifesting itself particularly for products such as sportswear, cosmetics, mobile phones and electric vehicles.
""Confidence in Chinese brands has been slowly growing for a number of years, but it accelerated through the pandemic,"" said Lei Chen, China consumer analyst with Credit Suisse's China Quantitative Insight (CQi). ""The improved product quality, marketing and distribution strategy, in addition to an increasing skepticism towards imported goods, especially foodstuffs, during Covid, have contributed to the rise of homegrown labels in China,"" Ms. Chen continued.
While the ""China Pride"" phenomenon is more pronounced among a younger generation that is largely wealthier than their parents were at the same stage in their lives, those younger consumers are also making luxury purchases earlier. This is one of the reasons why Credit Suisse analysts view this phenomenon as a long term trend for investors.
""Younger consumers are spending money earlier and are a key aspect of this ""China Pride"" idea that will become increasingly more meaningful as they mature into the next generation of older shoppers,"" Ms. Chen said.
Credit Suisse analysts expect those sectors hit hardest by Covid-19 in 2020, such travel, entertainment, cinemas and restaurants, to make a resurgence. In particular, the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 will boost sportswear and ""health conscious"" spending. But in general, Credit Suisse's analysts see this highly identifiable phenomenon of ""China Pride"" across the board – in infant formula, cosmetics and technology items, as well as in areas such as new energy vehicles and automobiles.
Sectors to watch
In the auto sector, China is expected to reduce its reliance on imported goods such as high-end luxury cars, pushing Chinese auto makers to establish high-end domestic auto brands that leverage the country's leadership in new energy and intelligent vehicle technologies, according to Bin Wang, Co- Head of APAC Autos Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
China's dominant position in electric vehicles is gathering pace, fomented by a rapidly evolving support sector. Battery prices continue to decline. Concurrently, the infrastructure to support electric vehicles, such as charging stations, are proliferating, while the rise of new entrants creates greater choices at different price points for domestic consumers.
""For the first quarter of 2021, Chinese local brands' new energy vehicles (NEV) accounted for 75.5% of total China NEV sales volume, reflecting consumer preference for Chinese branded vehicles,"" Mr. Wang said.
In the consumer sector, strong digital and marketing capabilities as well as a nimbleness to respond to consumers' changing needs, have led to strong momentum for domestic brands in sportswear, color cosmetics, skincare and infant milk formula, which have the potential to further increase market share.
Another factor contributing to ""China Pride"" as a long-term investment trend is that despite strong growth in the aforementioned sectors, Chinese brands are still underpenetrated when compared with the overall size of the market, with room for upside, according to Jesalyn Wong, China Consumer Analyst, Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
Strong and broad research coverage capabilities
Credit Suisse has one of the most comprehensive and highly recognized China Research coverage capabilities.

638,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

The judgment relates to life insurance policies of one client of Credit Suisse Life Bermuda. The life insurance subsidiary has been closed to new business and in wind-down for more than seven years and has no other material business that will be affected by this judgment.

640,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

643,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

647,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

""By bringing together complementary expertise, Credit Suisse and RavenPack have provided an objective and quantitative approach to information gathering and we are proud of this collaborative success Not only has the index recorded a 6.7% annualized performance* since its launch in 2017, but it also has offered a window into the attractiveness of asset allocations systematically selected by sophisticated data-driven analysis"" says Mike Heraty, Head of Institutional Solutions at Credit Suisse.

651,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

653,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
654,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

664,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

666,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

675,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

683,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

685,Credit Suisse research shows global food inequality and waste costs up to US$13.6 trillion annually,,London,08.06.2021,"Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) published a new research report entitled ‘The global food system: Identifying sustainable solutions’, the first under new Chairman António Horta-Osório. The report examines the discrepancy in food production and waste and highlights potential solutions to reduce the estimated US$13.6 trillion annual cost.
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the global eco-system. However, at present almost 700 million people are undernourished while 40% of the world’s adult population is overweight or obese. Some studies suggest that 20% of total deaths among adults can be attributed to dietary risks. Food production, and importantly consumption, needs to change significantly in order to address these challenges. Roadblocks that need to be overcome include the need for tighter regulation and a review of the global agricultural sector.
Food production and consumption has a major environmental impact
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% of the world’s freshwater consumption (see also: Water scarcity: addressing the key challenges). The analysis suggest that the environmental footprint of the global food system is likely to worsen significantly during the next few decades unless action is taken. The likely growth in the world’s population to c10 billion by 2050 coupled with a further shift in diets, especially across the expanding emerging middle class, could increase food-related emissions by a further 46% while demand for agricultural land could increase by 49%. This is incompatible with the need to achieve a net-zero emission environment globally by 2050.
Food loss and waste needs to be addressed
The challenges associated with malnutrition and the environmental footprint could partly be addressed by targeting food loss and waste. More than 30% of food produced is either lost or wasted which meant that in 2019 cUS$408 billion of produced food went unsold or uneaten. The combined economic, environmental and social cost associated with food waste is estimated at US$2.6 trillion by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Eliminating food waste in the US and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as c50% of food loss and waste occurs during the production and handling phase while 45% takes place in the distribution and consumption phase.
Who’s most at risk from food sustainability?
The simultaneous existence of undernourishment, obesity, the environmental footprint of food production and food waste puts the global food system under significant stress. However, these factors do not impact all countries in the same way suggesting that different solutions or strategies are needed for different countries. Using the Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, we find that France, the Netherlands and Canada score best while sustainability is lowest in Russia, Bulgaria and the UAE. Sustainability challenges differ between regions: developed countries score worse on diet patterns and food waste whereas emerging countries need to address food loss and general life quality.
A change in diet is required
A change in diet towards one that is plant-based appears inevitable if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research suggest that a plant-based diet not only has a c90% lower emission intensity than that of a current average diet but that it also has the potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults by c11million. There is strong growth potential for alternative animal-protein products and the report estimates that the market for alternative meat and dairy can grow from a current size of cUS$14 billion to US$1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite the involvement of more than 600 largely small and private companies in this field, the authors expect the traditional food companies to play a key role as they steadily transition their operations towards healthier and alternative food products.
Agriculture needs to go digital
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending power and declining arable land per capita suggest that a shift in diet alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large scale adoption of new technologies. The report highlights more than 70 including vertical farming and precision agricultural solutions.
Sharing, circular-solutions, packaging and cooling help address food loss and waste
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste to create new (food) products help too. Smart packaging solutions are being developed that not only help improve production yields but importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply chain from farm to the home. The development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food even more.
Eugène Klerk, Head of Global ESG & Thematic Research at Credit Suisse, said: “New technologies will need to accompany behavioral change. A shift in diet alone will not be enough in itself to make the food system wholly sustainable. Our report thus highlights an array of technological solutions that have the potential to improve productivity, expand the product offer and crucially reduce waste. In addition, it showcases innovative companies and their pioneering technologies designed to meet the challenge.”
Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, commented: “Sustainability is a risk that companies must adequately and proactively manage. And, as other sectors before it, the food industry is going to be increasingly scrutinized by investors, consumers and regulators, pushing it to focus more on sustainable and above all, healthy food. There could be material liability risks down the road otherwise. There are also likely beneficiaries from this transition, including technology companies providing “smart-agricultural” solutions, vertical and precision farming to meet urban food demand and provide productivity yields, companies who use circular-based or smart-packaging solutions and the development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions that help extend the lifespan of food even more. But ultimately, it is really about people living a longer and more healthy life altogether, and I am convinced that investors play a significant role in catalyzing these emerging trends in how they deploy their capital.”",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/06/en/credit-suisse-research-shows-global-food-inequality-and-waste-co.html
686,Credit Suisse Americas Foundation Makes a Commitment to Wake Tech,"Raleigh, NC, May 26, 2021 – Credit Suisse, one of the world's leading financial services providers, has announced a $250,000 commitment through its Credit Suisse Americas Foundation (CSAF) to support Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech).",New York,26.05.2021,"Wake Tech is the largest community college in North Carolina. It serves more than 70,000 adults each year across six campuses and three training centers, in addition to community sites and online learning options. Credit Suisse's grant will support the college's WakeWorks® Apprenticeship program, which offers strategic pathways to future workforce opportunities by enabling young people to learn new skills, gain access to employers, and earn credentials and income while doing so. The financial support will help the program to expand beyond its existing employer-sponsored model to offer young people from the local community the opportunity to secure an apprenticeship at a broader set of employers.
This investment is part of Credit Suisse's philanthropic commitment to Future Skills, which aims to equip young people with the skills and education needed to gain meaningful employment and fulfill their potential. While continuing to partner with organizations that prioritize college completion, we are also investing in additional pathways that enable strong career starts and upward mobility. This includes career integration into K-12 and post-secondary education along with quality two-year degrees, certifications and apprenticeships. This donation continues a multi-decade commitment by the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation to empower underrepresented young people. Through this and other partnerships, Credit Suisse upholds our responsibility to be more intentional about advancing diversity, equity and inclusion, internally and externally, by leveraging our platform and resources.
""We're very pleased to announce this support for Wake Tech, which represents Credit Suisse's first commitment to a community college and speaks to our confidence in their ability to help young people discover promising careers,"" said Eric Eckholdt, Executive Director of the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation and Head of Corporate Citizenship Americas. ""The WakeWorks® Apprenticeship program is a critical local resource. The program offers students a pathway to a more promising career and is forging an important connection between the education and business sectors in Wake County. We're honored to provide funding that will help strengthen and expand this vital conduit.""
""We are grateful to the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation for the gift and for their outstanding support of our college and our community,"" said Dr. Scott Ralls, President of Wake Tech Community College. ""At Wake Tech we sometimes use the phrase 'ladder economics' to refer to our college’s approach to inclusive opportunity through education, training and career development. The support by Credit Suisse will make a difference by ensuring that apprenticeship opportunities are more readily accessible and more people in our communities have the opportunity to ladder into the outstanding job opportunities available today in our region.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/05/en/credit-suisse-americas-foundation-makes-a-commitment-to-wake-tech.html
687,Credit Suisse sees strong future for domestic Chinese consumer brands,"The policy of ""Dual Circulation"", which will guide China's economic development for years to come, has driven an upsurge in domestic demand for Chinese consumer brands, according to Credit Suisse Securities Research analysts presenting at the 8th annual China A- Shares Conference.",Hong Kong,25.05.2021,"The Credit Suisse 8th China A-Shares Conference, taking place online from May 11-13, 2021, provides a platform for investors to explore the emerging trends in one of the world's largest and most dynamic stock markets. Participating in this year's conference are more than 70 leading A-share listed companies spanning 12 sectors including technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, industrials and autos and representing a total market capitalization of over RMB 9,147bn (USD 1,412.8bn).
Edmond Huang, Head of China/Hong Kong Securities Research, Credit Suisse, described ""Dual Circulation"" as a strategic choice to rebalance the Chinese economy away from an overreliance on external demand, provide a catalyst for unleashing domestic demand and achieve more sustainable development.
""On the supply side, China will step up technological innovation to move along the global value chain. On the demand side, it aims to boost household incomes to stimulate domestic demand,"" Mr. Huang said.
The global pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions have been two principal drivers of the ""Dual Circulation"" strategy, an inversion of China's previous strategy of globalization and trade-led growth.
The contribution to the Chinese economy from net exports is no longer as significant as it was 20 years ago, while the ageing population and growing wallets of Chinese consumers have also been a significant contributor to this new economic development model.
""Chinese brands have made remarkable progress in upgrading the quality of their products, with better aesthetics, innovation, and technology enhancements contributing to their overall enhanced appeal. They also have advantages in being able to adapt their products faster to changing consumer sentiment,"" Mr. Huang added.
This has, in turn, driven a strong sense of national pride in Chinese brands from domestic consumers. The phenomenon, known as ""China Pride"", is manifesting itself particularly for products such as sportswear, cosmetics, mobile phones and electric vehicles.
""Confidence in Chinese brands has been slowly growing for a number of years, but it accelerated through the pandemic,"" said Lei Chen, China consumer analyst with Credit Suisse's China Quantitative Insight (CQi). ""The improved product quality, marketing and distribution strategy, in addition to an increasing skepticism towards imported goods, especially foodstuffs, during Covid, have contributed to the rise of homegrown labels in China,"" Ms. Chen continued.
While the ""China Pride"" phenomenon is more pronounced among a younger generation that is largely wealthier than their parents were at the same stage in their lives, those younger consumers are also making luxury purchases earlier. This is one of the reasons why Credit Suisse analysts view this phenomenon as a long term trend for investors.
""Younger consumers are spending money earlier and are a key aspect of this ""China Pride"" idea that will become increasingly more meaningful as they mature into the next generation of older shoppers,"" Ms. Chen said.
Credit Suisse analysts expect those sectors hit hardest by Covid-19 in 2020, such travel, entertainment, cinemas and restaurants, to make a resurgence. In particular, the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 will boost sportswear and ""health conscious"" spending. But in general, Credit Suisse's analysts see this highly identifiable phenomenon of ""China Pride"" across the board – in infant formula, cosmetics and technology items, as well as in areas such as new energy vehicles and automobiles.

In the auto sector, China is expected to reduce its reliance on imported goods such as high-end luxury cars, pushing Chinese auto makers to establish high-end domestic auto brands that leverage the country's leadership in new energy and intelligent vehicle technologies, according to Bin Wang, Co- Head of APAC Autos Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
China's dominant position in electric vehicles is gathering pace, fomented by a rapidly evolving support sector. Battery prices continue to decline. Concurrently, the infrastructure to support electric vehicles, such as charging stations, are proliferating, while the rise of new entrants creates greater choices at different price points for domestic consumers.
""For the first quarter of 2021, Chinese local brands' new energy vehicles (NEV) accounted for 75.5% of total China NEV sales volume, reflecting consumer preference for Chinese branded vehicles,"" Mr. Wang said.
In the consumer sector, strong digital and marketing capabilities as well as a nimbleness to respond to consumers' changing needs, have led to strong momentum for domestic brands in sportswear, color cosmetics, skincare and infant milk formula, which have the potential to further increase market share.
Another factor contributing to ""China Pride"" as a long-term investment trend is that despite strong growth in the aforementioned sectors, Chinese brands are still underpenetrated when compared with the overall size of the market, with room for upside, according to Jesalyn Wong, China Consumer Analyst, Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
Strong and broad research coverage capabilities
Credit Suisse has one of the most comprehensive and highly recognized China Research coverage capabilities. The Credit Suisse Equity Research team covers more than 460 Chinese-listed stocks, including about 216 domestic A-shares, which represent over 70% of the CSI-300 index constituents by market capitalization. In addition, the HOLT platform covers close to 2,100 A-share companies and more than 3,000 stocks across Hong Kong and mainland China.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/05/en/credit-suisse-sees-strong-future-for-domestic-chinese-consumer-brands.html

At the universities and colleges which partner with Braven, Fellows earn course credit while gaining valuable insights and experiences that are designed to accelerate job attainment within 6 months of graduation. After seeing positive results in three other US markets, Braven launched in New York in the Spring of 2020 in partnership with the City University of New York and Lehman College, undeterred by the challenges of doing so in a virtual landscape. To date, Braven has served nearly 400 students and is on a path to serve more than 1,800 students within four years.

As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
694,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release
Credit Suisse expects to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 on April 27, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/agm-2022-invitation.html

The judgment relates to life insurance policies of one client of Credit Suisse Life Bermuda. The life insurance subsidiary has been closed to new business and in wind-down for more than seven years and has no other material business that will be affected by this judgment.
The judgment is not yet final and is subject to appeal, which Credit Suisse Life Bermuda intends to vigorously pursue.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/decision-court-bermuda.html
696,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

699,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets.

703,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

""By bringing together complementary expertise, Credit Suisse and RavenPack have provided an objective and quantitative approach to information gathering and we are proud of this collaborative success Not only has the index recorded a 6.7% annualized performance* since its launch in 2017, but it also has offered a window into the attractiveness of asset allocations systematically selected by sophisticated data-driven analysis"" says Mike Heraty, Head of Institutional Solutions at Credit Suisse.

707,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

709,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
710,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

720,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

722,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

731,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

739,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

741,Credit Suisse research shows global food inequality and waste costs up to US$13.6 trillion annually,,London,08.06.2021,"Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) published a new research report entitled ‘The global food system: Identifying sustainable solutions’, the first under new Chairman António Horta-Osório. The report examines the discrepancy in food production and waste and highlights potential solutions to reduce the estimated US$13.6 trillion annual cost.
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the global eco-system. However, at present almost 700 million people are undernourished while 40% of the world’s adult population is overweight or obese. Some studies suggest that 20% of total deaths among adults can be attributed to dietary risks. Food production, and importantly consumption, needs to change significantly in order to address these challenges. Roadblocks that need to be overcome include the need for tighter regulation and a review of the global agricultural sector.
Food production and consumption has a major environmental impact
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% of the world’s freshwater consumption (see also: Water scarcity: addressing the key challenges). The analysis suggest that the environmental footprint of the global food system is likely to worsen significantly during the next few decades unless action is taken. The likely growth in the world’s population to c10 billion by 2050 coupled with a further shift in diets, especially across the expanding emerging middle class, could increase food-related emissions by a further 46% while demand for agricultural land could increase by 49%. This is incompatible with the need to achieve a net-zero emission environment globally by 2050.
Food loss and waste needs to be addressed
The challenges associated with malnutrition and the environmental footprint could partly be addressed by targeting food loss and waste. More than 30% of food produced is either lost or wasted which meant that in 2019 cUS$408 billion of produced food went unsold or uneaten. The combined economic, environmental and social cost associated with food waste is estimated at US$2.6 trillion by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Eliminating food waste in the US and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as c50% of food loss and waste occurs during the production and handling phase while 45% takes place in the distribution and consumption phase.
Who’s most at risk from food sustainability?
The simultaneous existence of undernourishment, obesity, the environmental footprint of food production and food waste puts the global food system under significant stress. However, these factors do not impact all countries in the same way suggesting that different solutions or strategies are needed for different countries. Using the Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, we find that France, the Netherlands and Canada score best while sustainability is lowest in Russia, Bulgaria and the UAE. Sustainability challenges differ between regions: developed countries score worse on diet patterns and food waste whereas emerging countries need to address food loss and general life quality.
A change in diet is required
A change in diet towards one that is plant-based appears inevitable if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research suggest that a plant-based diet not only has a c90% lower emission intensity than that of a current average diet but that it also has the potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults by c11million. There is strong growth potential for alternative animal-protein products and the report estimates that the market for alternative meat and dairy can grow from a current size of cUS$14 billion to US$1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite the involvement of more than 600 largely small and private companies in this field, the authors expect the traditional food companies to play a key role as they steadily transition their operations towards healthier and alternative food products.
Agriculture needs to go digital
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending power and declining arable land per capita suggest that a shift in diet alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large scale adoption of new technologies. The report highlights more than 70 including vertical farming and precision agricultural solutions.
Sharing, circular-solutions, packaging and cooling help address food loss and waste
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste to create new (food) products help too. Smart packaging solutions are being developed that not only help improve production yields but importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply chain from farm to the home. The development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food even more.
Eugène Klerk, Head of Global ESG & Thematic Research at Credit Suisse, said: “New technologies will need to accompany behavioral change. A shift in diet alone will not be enough in itself to make the food system wholly sustainable. Our report thus highlights an array of technological solutions that have the potential to improve productivity, expand the product offer and crucially reduce waste. In addition, it showcases innovative companies and their pioneering technologies designed to meet the challenge.”
Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, commented: “Sustainability is a risk that companies must adequately and proactively manage. And, as other sectors before it, the food industry is going to be increasingly scrutinized by investors, consumers and regulators, pushing it to focus more on sustainable and above all, healthy food. There could be material liability risks down the road otherwise. There are also likely beneficiaries from this transition, including technology companies providing “smart-agricultural” solutions, vertical and precision farming to meet urban food demand and provide productivity yields, companies who use circular-based or smart-packaging solutions and the development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions that help extend the lifespan of food even more. But ultimately, it is really about people living a longer and more healthy life altogether, and I am convinced that investors play a significant role in catalyzing these emerging trends in how they deploy their capital.”",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/06/en/credit-suisse-research-shows-global-food-inequality-and-waste-co.html
742,Credit Suisse Americas Foundation Makes a Commitment to Wake Tech,"Raleigh, NC, May 26, 2021 – Credit Suisse, one of the world's leading financial services providers, has announced a $250,000 commitment through its Credit Suisse Americas Foundation (CSAF) to support Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech).",New York,26.05.2021,"Wake Tech is the largest community college in North Carolina. It serves more than 70,000 adults each year across six campuses and three training centers, in addition to community sites and online learning options. Credit Suisse's grant will support the college's WakeWorks® Apprenticeship program, which offers strategic pathways to future workforce opportunities by enabling young people to learn new skills, gain access to employers, and earn credentials and income while doing so. The financial support will help the program to expand beyond its existing employer-sponsored model to offer young people from the local community the opportunity to secure an apprenticeship at a broader set of employers.
This investment is part of Credit Suisse's philanthropic commitment to Future Skills, which aims to equip young people with the skills and education needed to gain meaningful employment and fulfill their potential. While continuing to partner with organizations that prioritize college completion, we are also investing in additional pathways that enable strong career starts and upward mobility. This includes career integration into K-12 and post-secondary education along with quality two-year degrees, certifications and apprenticeships. This donation continues a multi-decade commitment by the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation to empower underrepresented young people. Through this and other partnerships, Credit Suisse upholds our responsibility to be more intentional about advancing diversity, equity and inclusion, internally and externally, by leveraging our platform and resources.
""We're very pleased to announce this support for Wake Tech, which represents Credit Suisse's first commitment to a community college and speaks to our confidence in their ability to help young people discover promising careers,"" said Eric Eckholdt, Executive Director of the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation and Head of Corporate Citizenship Americas. ""The WakeWorks® Apprenticeship program is a critical local resource. The program offers students a pathway to a more promising career and is forging an important connection between the education and business sectors in Wake County.

""We are grateful to the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation for the gift and for their outstanding support of our college and our community,"" said Dr. Scott Ralls, President of Wake Tech Community College. ""At Wake Tech we sometimes use the phrase 'ladder economics' to refer to our college’s approach to inclusive opportunity through education, training and career development. The support by Credit Suisse will make a difference by ensuring that apprenticeship opportunities are more readily accessible and more people in our communities have the opportunity to ladder into the outstanding job opportunities available today in our region.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/05/en/credit-suisse-americas-foundation-makes-a-commitment-to-wake-tech.html
743,Credit Suisse sees strong future for domestic Chinese consumer brands,"The policy of ""Dual Circulation"", which will guide China's economic development for years to come, has driven an upsurge in domestic demand for Chinese consumer brands, according to Credit Suisse Securities Research analysts presenting at the 8th annual China A- Shares Conference.",Hong Kong,25.05.2021,"The Credit Suisse 8th China A-Shares Conference, taking place online from May 11-13, 2021, provides a platform for investors to explore the emerging trends in one of the world's largest and most dynamic stock markets. Participating in this year's conference are more than 70 leading A-share listed companies spanning 12 sectors including technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, industrials and autos and representing a total market capitalization of over RMB 9,147bn (USD 1,412.8bn).
Edmond Huang, Head of China/Hong Kong Securities Research, Credit Suisse, described ""Dual Circulation"" as a strategic choice to rebalance the Chinese economy away from an overreliance on external demand, provide a catalyst for unleashing domestic demand and achieve more sustainable development.
""On the supply side, China will step up technological innovation to move along the global value chain. On the demand side, it aims to boost household incomes to stimulate domestic demand,"" Mr. Huang said.
The global pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions have been two principal drivers of the ""Dual Circulation"" strategy, an inversion of China's previous strategy of globalization and trade-led growth.
The contribution to the Chinese economy from net exports is no longer as significant as it was 20 years ago, while the ageing population and growing wallets of Chinese consumers have also been a significant contributor to this new economic development model.
""Chinese brands have made remarkable progress in upgrading the quality of their products, with better aesthetics, innovation, and technology enhancements contributing to their overall enhanced appeal. They also have advantages in being able to adapt their products faster to changing consumer sentiment,"" Mr. Huang added.
This has, in turn, driven a strong sense of national pride in Chinese brands from domestic consumers. The phenomenon, known as ""China Pride"", is manifesting itself particularly for products such as sportswear, cosmetics, mobile phones and electric vehicles.
""Confidence in Chinese brands has been slowly growing for a number of years, but it accelerated through the pandemic,"" said Lei Chen, China consumer analyst with Credit Suisse's China Quantitative Insight (CQi). ""The improved product quality, marketing and distribution strategy, in addition to an increasing skepticism towards imported goods, especially foodstuffs, during Covid, have contributed to the rise of homegrown labels in China,"" Ms. Chen continued.
While the ""China Pride"" phenomenon is more pronounced among a younger generation that is largely wealthier than their parents were at the same stage in their lives, those younger consumers are also making luxury purchases earlier. This is one of the reasons why Credit Suisse analysts view this phenomenon as a long term trend for investors.
""Younger consumers are spending money earlier and are a key aspect of this ""China Pride"" idea that will become increasingly more meaningful as they mature into the next generation of older shoppers,"" Ms. Chen said.
Credit Suisse analysts expect those sectors hit hardest by Covid-19 in 2020, such travel, entertainment, cinemas and restaurants, to make a resurgence. In particular, the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 will boost sportswear and ""health conscious"" spending. But in general, Credit Suisse's analysts see this highly identifiable phenomenon of ""China Pride"" across the board – in infant formula, cosmetics and technology items, as well as in areas such as new energy vehicles and automobiles.
Sectors to watch
In the auto sector, China is expected to reduce its reliance on imported goods such as high-end luxury cars, pushing Chinese auto makers to establish high-end domestic auto brands that leverage the country's leadership in new energy and intelligent vehicle technologies, according to Bin Wang, Co- Head of APAC Autos Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
China's dominant position in electric vehicles is gathering pace, fomented by a rapidly evolving support sector. Battery prices continue to decline. Concurrently, the infrastructure to support electric vehicles, such as charging stations, are proliferating, while the rise of new entrants creates greater choices at different price points for domestic consumers.
""For the first quarter of 2021, Chinese local brands' new energy vehicles (NEV) accounted for 75.5% of total China NEV sales volume, reflecting consumer preference for Chinese branded vehicles,"" Mr. Wang said.
In the consumer sector, strong digital and marketing capabilities as well as a nimbleness to respond to consumers' changing needs, have led to strong momentum for domestic brands in sportswear, color cosmetics, skincare and infant milk formula, which have the potential to further increase market share.
Another factor contributing to ""China Pride"" as a long-term investment trend is that despite strong growth in the aforementioned sectors, Chinese brands are still underpenetrated when compared with the overall size of the market, with room for upside, according to Jesalyn Wong, China Consumer Analyst, Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
Strong and broad research coverage capabilities
Credit Suisse has one of the most comprehensive and highly recognized China Research coverage capabilities. The Credit Suisse Equity Research team covers more than 460 Chinese-listed stocks, including about 216 domestic A-shares, which represent over 70% of the CSI-300 index constituents by market capitalization.

At the universities and colleges which partner with Braven, Fellows earn course credit while gaining valuable insights and experiences that are designed to accelerate job attainment within 6 months of graduation. After seeing positive results in three other US markets, Braven launched in New York in the Spring of 2020 in partnership with the City University of New York and Lehman College, undeterred by the challenges of doing so in a virtual landscape. To date, Braven has served nearly 400 students and is on a path to serve more than 1,800 students within four years.

Credit Suisse Group AG today announces that it has determined the conversion ratio and conversion price for the two series of mandatory convertible notes (“MCNs”), the Series A MCNs and the Series B MCNs, whose placement was announced on April 22, 2021 in a separate press release (the “April 22 Release”) as well as the subscription ratio applicable to the preferential subscription rights (“Rights”) further described in the April 22 Release to be granted to shareholders of Credit Suisse Group AG in relation to the Series B MCNs.
The MCNs’ conversion ratio has been determined to be 23,121.38728 shares per CHF 200,000 principal amount in respect of the Series A MCNs and 115.60694 shares per CHF 1,000 principal amount in respect of the Series B MCNs, which in each case is equal to the CHF-denominated principal amount of one MCN of the relevant series divided by the conversion price, which has been determined to be CHF 8.65 in respect of each series. As discussed in the April 22 Release, the conversion price represents the average of the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of Credit Suisse Group AG’s shares on April 22 and 23, 2021, less a discount of 5.0%. As a result of such determinations, the aggregate principal amount of Series A MCNs to be issued will be CHF 865 million and the aggregate principal amount of Series B MCNs to be issued will be CHF 891 million.

Credit Suisse Group AG today announces that it has placed two series of mandatory convertible notes (“MCNs”), Series A MCNs and Series B MCNs, which will be convertible into 100 million shares and 103 million shares of Credit Suisse Group AG, respectively (together “the Offering”). Both series were placed to a selected group of core shareholders, institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.
The Series A MCNs have already been placed and allocated directly with such investors.
The Series B MCNs were pre-placed to such investors but are being re-offered to existing shareholders of Credit Suisse Group AG by way of an offering of preferential subscription rights (“Rights”).
The investors have entered into definitive agreements to purchase any Series B MCNs not taken up by shareholders, thereby ensuring full placement of both series of MCNs.
As discussed in our earnings release published today, our capital position remained solid with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% and a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.8% as per the end of 1Q21. However, with the Offering, we expect to further strengthen our capital position in line with our intention to achieve a CET1 ratio of approximately 13% and a minimum CET1 leverage ratio of 4%.
The MCNs will be issued by Credit Suisse Group (Guernsey) VII, Limited (the “Issuer”) on or around May 12, 2021, and will benefit from an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by Credit Suisse Group AG of amounts due under them and, on a subordinated basis, the delivery of shares on their conversion. The MCNs will be mandatorily convertible at their 6 month maturity (but subject to early conversion upon the occurrence of certain events, as well as at the option of the holder after an initial 40-day period).
The MCNs’ conversion ratio will be their CHF-denominated principal amount divided by their conversion price, which will be set at an at-the-market discount of 5.0% to the average of the volume-weighted average price of Credit Suisse Group AG’s shares on April 22 and 23, 2021. Unless converted early at the option of the holder, the Issuer will pay a fixed interest amount on the MCNs at the time of their conversion equivalent to a rate of 3.0% per annum. The Issuer will also pay a floating interest amount on the MCNs to the extent any cash dividend or cash distribution is made by Credit Suisse Group AG to its shareholders after the pricing date but prior to the relevant conversion date.
For the series B MCNs, Credit Suisse Group AG shareholders will be granted one Right for each registered share held after close of trading on April 27, 2021. The Rights will, subject to certain limitations based on residency, be exercisable from April 28, 2021 until May 6, 2021 at 12.00 noon (CEST).
The shares of Credit Suisse Group AG underlying the Series A MCNs will be issued from Credit Suisse Group AG's current conditional capital. The shares of Credit Suisse Group AG underlying the Series B MCNs will be issued from Credit Suisse Group AG's current authorized capital. As the full amount of the current authorized capital is expected to be utilized for such issuance, the Board has decided to withdraw, at the Annual General Meeting 2021, its proposal for a moderate increase and the extension of the authorized capital.

754,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.

763,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA.

767,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime.

769,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
770,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

780,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

782,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

791,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

799,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

801,Credit Suisse research shows global food inequality and waste costs up to US$13.6 trillion annually,,London,08.06.2021,"Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) published a new research report entitled ‘The global food system: Identifying sustainable solutions’, the first under new Chairman António Horta-Osório. The report examines the discrepancy in food production and waste and highlights potential solutions to reduce the estimated US$13.6 trillion annual cost.
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the global eco-system. However, at present almost 700 million people are undernourished while 40% of the world’s adult population is overweight or obese. Some studies suggest that 20% of total deaths among adults can be attributed to dietary risks. Food production, and importantly consumption, needs to change significantly in order to address these challenges. Roadblocks that need to be overcome include the need for tighter regulation and a review of the global agricultural sector.
Food production and consumption has a major environmental impact
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% of the world’s freshwater consumption (see also: Water scarcity: addressing the key challenges). The analysis suggest that the environmental footprint of the global food system is likely to worsen significantly during the next few decades unless action is taken. The likely growth in the world’s population to c10 billion by 2050 coupled with a further shift in diets, especially across the expanding emerging middle class, could increase food-related emissions by a further 46% while demand for agricultural land could increase by 49%. This is incompatible with the need to achieve a net-zero emission environment globally by 2050.
Food loss and waste needs to be addressed
The challenges associated with malnutrition and the environmental footprint could partly be addressed by targeting food loss and waste. More than 30% of food produced is either lost or wasted which meant that in 2019 cUS$408 billion of produced food went unsold or uneaten. The combined economic, environmental and social cost associated with food waste is estimated at US$2.6 trillion by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Eliminating food waste in the US and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as c50% of food loss and waste occurs during the production and handling phase while 45% takes place in the distribution and consumption phase.
Who’s most at risk from food sustainability?
The simultaneous existence of undernourishment, obesity, the environmental footprint of food production and food waste puts the global food system under significant stress. However, these factors do not impact all countries in the same way suggesting that different solutions or strategies are needed for different countries. Using the Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, we find that France, the Netherlands and Canada score best while sustainability is lowest in Russia, Bulgaria and the UAE. Sustainability challenges differ between regions: developed countries score worse on diet patterns and food waste whereas emerging countries need to address food loss and general life quality.
A change in diet is required
A change in diet towards one that is plant-based appears inevitable if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research suggest that a plant-based diet not only has a c90% lower emission intensity than that of a current average diet but that it also has the potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults by c11million. There is strong growth potential for alternative animal-protein products and the report estimates that the market for alternative meat and dairy can grow from a current size of cUS$14 billion to US$1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite the involvement of more than 600 largely small and private companies in this field, the authors expect the traditional food companies to play a key role as they steadily transition their operations towards healthier and alternative food products.
Agriculture needs to go digital
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending power and declining arable land per capita suggest that a shift in diet alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large scale adoption of new technologies. The report highlights more than 70 including vertical farming and precision agricultural solutions.
Sharing, circular-solutions, packaging and cooling help address food loss and waste
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste to create new (food) products help too. Smart packaging solutions are being developed that not only help improve production yields but importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply chain from farm to the home. The development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food even more.
Eugène Klerk, Head of Global ESG & Thematic Research at Credit Suisse, said: “New technologies will need to accompany behavioral change. A shift in diet alone will not be enough in itself to make the food system wholly sustainable. Our report thus highlights an array of technological solutions that have the potential to improve productivity, expand the product offer and crucially reduce waste. In addition, it showcases innovative companies and their pioneering technologies designed to meet the challenge.”
Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, commented: “Sustainability is a risk that companies must adequately and proactively manage. And, as other sectors before it, the food industry is going to be increasingly scrutinized by investors, consumers and regulators, pushing it to focus more on sustainable and above all, healthy food. There could be material liability risks down the road otherwise. There are also likely beneficiaries from this transition, including technology companies providing “smart-agricultural” solutions, vertical and precision farming to meet urban food demand and provide productivity yields, companies who use circular-based or smart-packaging solutions and the development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions that help extend the lifespan of food even more. But ultimately, it is really about people living a longer and more healthy life altogether, and I am convinced that investors play a significant role in catalyzing these emerging trends in how they deploy their capital.”",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/06/en/credit-suisse-research-shows-global-food-inequality-and-waste-co.html
802,Credit Suisse Americas Foundation Makes a Commitment to Wake Tech,"Raleigh, NC, May 26, 2021 – Credit Suisse, one of the world's leading financial services providers, has announced a $250,000 commitment through its Credit Suisse Americas Foundation (CSAF) to support Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech).",New York,26.05.2021,"Wake Tech is the largest community college in North Carolina. It serves more than 70,000 adults each year across six campuses and three training centers, in addition to community sites and online learning options. Credit Suisse's grant will support the college's WakeWorks® Apprenticeship program, which offers strategic pathways to future workforce opportunities by enabling young people to learn new skills, gain access to employers, and earn credentials and income while doing so. The financial support will help the program to expand beyond its existing employer-sponsored model to offer young people from the local community the opportunity to secure an apprenticeship at a broader set of employers.
This investment is part of Credit Suisse's philanthropic commitment to Future Skills, which aims to equip young people with the skills and education needed to gain meaningful employment and fulfill their potential. While continuing to partner with organizations that prioritize college completion, we are also investing in additional pathways that enable strong career starts and upward mobility.

803,Credit Suisse sees strong future for domestic Chinese consumer brands,"The policy of ""Dual Circulation"", which will guide China's economic development for years to come, has driven an upsurge in domestic demand for Chinese consumer brands, according to Credit Suisse Securities Research analysts presenting at the 8th annual China A- Shares Conference.",Hong Kong,25.05.2021,"The Credit Suisse 8th China A-Shares Conference, taking place online from May 11-13, 2021, provides a platform for investors to explore the emerging trends in one of the world's largest and most dynamic stock markets. Participating in this year's conference are more than 70 leading A-share listed companies spanning 12 sectors including technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, industrials and autos and representing a total market capitalization of over RMB 9,147bn (USD 1,412.8bn).
Edmond Huang, Head of China/Hong Kong Securities Research, Credit Suisse, described ""Dual Circulation"" as a strategic choice to rebalance the Chinese economy away from an overreliance on external demand, provide a catalyst for unleashing domestic demand and achieve more sustainable development.
""On the supply side, China will step up technological innovation to move along the global value chain. On the demand side, it aims to boost household incomes to stimulate domestic demand,"" Mr. Huang said.
The global pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions have been two principal drivers of the ""Dual Circulation"" strategy, an inversion of China's previous strategy of globalization and trade-led growth.
The contribution to the Chinese economy from net exports is no longer as significant as it was 20 years ago, while the ageing population and growing wallets of Chinese consumers have also been a significant contributor to this new economic development model.
""Chinese brands have made remarkable progress in upgrading the quality of their products, with better aesthetics, innovation, and technology enhancements contributing to their overall enhanced appeal. They also have advantages in being able to adapt their products faster to changing consumer sentiment,"" Mr. Huang added.
This has, in turn, driven a strong sense of national pride in Chinese brands from domestic consumers. The phenomenon, known as ""China Pride"", is manifesting itself particularly for products such as sportswear, cosmetics, mobile phones and electric vehicles.
""Confidence in Chinese brands has been slowly growing for a number of years, but it accelerated through the pandemic,"" said Lei Chen, China consumer analyst with Credit Suisse's China Quantitative Insight (CQi). ""The improved product quality, marketing and distribution strategy, in addition to an increasing skepticism towards imported goods, especially foodstuffs, during Covid, have contributed to the rise of homegrown labels in China,"" Ms. Chen continued.
While the ""China Pride"" phenomenon is more pronounced among a younger generation that is largely wealthier than their parents were at the same stage in their lives, those younger consumers are also making luxury purchases earlier. This is one of the reasons why Credit Suisse analysts view this phenomenon as a long term trend for investors.
""Younger consumers are spending money earlier and are a key aspect of this ""China Pride"" idea that will become increasingly more meaningful as they mature into the next generation of older shoppers,"" Ms. Chen said.
Credit Suisse analysts expect those sectors hit hardest by Covid-19 in 2020, such travel, entertainment, cinemas and restaurants, to make a resurgence. In particular, the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 will boost sportswear and ""health conscious"" spending. But in general, Credit Suisse's analysts see this highly identifiable phenomenon of ""China Pride"" across the board – in infant formula, cosmetics and technology items, as well as in areas such as new energy vehicles and automobiles.
Sectors to watch
In the auto sector, China is expected to reduce its reliance on imported goods such as high-end luxury cars, pushing Chinese auto makers to establish high-end domestic auto brands that leverage the country's leadership in new energy and intelligent vehicle technologies, according to Bin Wang, Co- Head of APAC Autos Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
China's dominant position in electric vehicles is gathering pace, fomented by a rapidly evolving support sector. Battery prices continue to decline. Concurrently, the infrastructure to support electric vehicles, such as charging stations, are proliferating, while the rise of new entrants creates greater choices at different price points for domestic consumers.
""For the first quarter of 2021, Chinese local brands' new energy vehicles (NEV) accounted for 75.5% of total China NEV sales volume, reflecting consumer preference for Chinese branded vehicles,"" Mr. Wang said.
In the consumer sector, strong digital and marketing capabilities as well as a nimbleness to respond to consumers' changing needs, have led to strong momentum for domestic brands in sportswear, color cosmetics, skincare and infant milk formula, which have the potential to further increase market share.
Another factor contributing to ""China Pride"" as a long-term investment trend is that despite strong growth in the aforementioned sectors, Chinese brands are still underpenetrated when compared with the overall size of the market, with room for upside, according to Jesalyn Wong, China Consumer Analyst, Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
Strong and broad research coverage capabilities
Credit Suisse has one of the most comprehensive and highly recognized China Research coverage capabilities. The Credit Suisse Equity Research team covers more than 460 Chinese-listed stocks, including about 216 domestic A-shares, which represent over 70% of the CSI-300 index constituents by market capitalization.

Unless converted early at the option of the holder, the Issuer will pay a fixed interest amount on the MCNs at the time of their conversion equivalent to a rate of 3.0% per annum. The Issuer will also pay a floating interest amount on the MCNs to the extent any cash dividend or cash distribution is made by Credit Suisse Group AG to its shareholders after the pricing date but prior to the relevant conversion date.
For the series B MCNs, Credit Suisse Group AG shareholders will be granted one Right for each registered share held after close of trading on April 27, 2021. The Rights will, subject to certain limitations based on residency, be exercisable from April 28, 2021 until May 6, 2021 at 12.00 noon (CEST).
The shares of Credit Suisse Group AG underlying the Series A MCNs will be issued from Credit Suisse Group AG's current conditional capital. The shares of Credit Suisse Group AG underlying the Series B MCNs will be issued from Credit Suisse Group AG's current authorized capital. As the full amount of the current authorized capital is expected to be utilized for such issuance, the Board has decided to withdraw, at the Annual General Meeting 2021, its proposal for a moderate increase and the extension of the authorized capital.

813,Credit Suisse Asset Management update on Supply Chain Finance Funds; next distribution to investors of USD 1.7 billion,"Since the four Supply Chain Finance Funds (SCFFs) were suspended on March 1, 2021, we have made progress on the wind-down of the funds.",Zurich,13.04.2021,"As at April 9, 2021 we have collected USD 2.0 billion from receivables redeemed since March 1, 2021. This results in cash and cash equivalent levels currently in the SCFFs amounting to USD 2.3 billion. The total cash position, including the USD 3.1 billion that already has been distributed to investors, thus amounts to USD 5.4 billion, or more than half of the total Assets under Management of the four funds at the time of their suspension. We are therefore able to announce a second cash distribution to investors, amounting to USD 1.7 billion, commencing today. This takes the total distribution so far to USD 4.8 billion.
Credit Suisse Asset Management continues to work on identifying and progressing options to secure recovery. Liquidation proceeds will be paid out to investors as soon as feasible in one or more instalments until the investors receive the funds’ total collected net liquidation proceeds. Investors will receive notification of such payments.
Credit Suisse Asset Management is in active dialogue with the Joint Administrators of Greensill Capital (UK) Ltd, Grant Thornton, and, where appropriate, is engaging directly with potentially delinquent obligors and other creditors. Claims will also be made under relevant insurance policies where there is evidence of non-payment or default. It is important to note that in many of these cases of non-payment or default, the obligors are firms with tangible assets. The current assessment is that there is potential for recovery in these cases although clearly there is a considerable degree of uncertainty as to the amounts that ultimately will be distributed to investors in respect of the funds. We will continue to report on the progress we are making with these situations as appropriate.
Furthermore, Credit Suisse Asset Management will consider appropriate legal actions to protect fund holders’ interests.
Outlook
We remain acutely aware of the uncertainty that the wind-down process creates for those of our clients who are invested in the funds. We are doing everything that we can to provide them with clarity, to work through issues as they arise and, ultimately, to return cash to them. We intend to provide a further update on the progress made by the end of April 2021.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/04/en/csam-supply-chain-finance-funds.html

815,Trading Update,,Zurich,06.04.2021,"While our financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review, we would expect to report a pre-tax loss for 1Q 2021 of approximately CHF 900 million. This includes a charge of CHF 4.4 billion in respect of the failure by a US-based hedge fund to meet its margin commitments as we announced on March 29, 2021. This will negate the very strong performance that had otherwise been achieved by our investment banking businesses and the increase in the year-on-year profits in all three of our wealth management businesses, as well as in asset management, with particular strength in our Asia Pacific division. Net new assets were positive during the quarter across our three wealth management businesses as well as in asset management and in the Swiss corporate and institutional business. 
In terms of our capital position, while this is also still subject to our usual end-period finalization and review processes, we would currently expect the 1Q 2021 CET1 ratio to be at least 12%. With regard to leverage, we expect our 1Q 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio to be at least 5.4% and our 1Q 2021 CET1 leverage ratio to be at least 3.7%. Following the completion of share buybacks in 1Q 2021, we have suspended the share buyback program and we do not intend to resume share purchases before we have regained our target capital ratios and restored our dividend. As of the end of 1Q21, our liquidity position remains strong with HQLA balances expected to exceed USD 200 billion and the Group liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) expected to exceed 200%.
With regard to the four supply chain finance funds, where we continue to see cash inflows, we will distribute a separate update on further repayments within the next few days.
We acknowledge that both the US hedge fund and the supply chain finance fund matters require substantial further review and scrutiny. The Board of Directors has launched investigations into both of these matters which will not only focus on the direct issues arising from each of them, but also reflect on the broader consequences and lessons learned. We have also undertaken senior management changes within the Investment Bank division and within the Risk and Compliance organization as separately announced today. 
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group said: ""The significant loss in our Prime Services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable. In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders. Together with the Board of Directors, we are fully committed to addressing these situations. Serious lessons will be learned. Credit Suisse remains a formidable institution with a rich history.""

Item 1.1 Consultative vote on the 2020 Compensation Report
The Board of Directors has updated the Compensation Report following its decision to withdraw its proposals regarding the variable compensation for the Executive Board, comprising the short-term incentive compensation (STI), which was based on 2020 performance and the 2021 long-term incentive opportunities (LTI), for which payout would have been determined based on prospective performance over the three-year period 2021–2023. In addition, the Chairman of the Board has proposed to waive his Chair fee of CHF 1.5 million, which would have been awarded to him at the end of the 2020 AGM to 2021 AGM period. The Board of Directors has agreed to and approved his proposal.
The Board of Directors recommends that the 2020 Compensation Report, as updated, be accepted by the shareholders in a consultative vote.
Item 2 Discharge of the members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board

Before joining Credit Suisse, he was UBS’s General Counsel for APAC Wealth Management, based in Hong Kong.
All three will report to Thomas Gottstein.
Further Actions by the Board of Directors
In March 2021, the tactical crisis committee of the Board of Directors consisting of the Chairman, the Chairs of the Audit Committee and Risk Committee and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee was activated to exercise close oversight and ensure timely decision making with respect to the resolution of the issues in connection with the Credit Suisse Asset Management managed supply chain finance funds. The mandate of this committee has in the meanwhile been expanded to include the significant US-based hedge fund matter. The tactical crisis committee works closely with the CEO and the rest of the management team.
The Board of Directors has launched two investigations, to be carried out by external parties, into the supply chain finance funds matter and into the significant US-based hedge fund matter. These investigations will be supervised by a special committee of the Board of Directors and will not only focus on the direct issues arising from those matters, but also reflect on the broader consequences and lessons learned.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/04/en/bod-announcement.html

818,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

820,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

823,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

827,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

831,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

833,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
834,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

844,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

846,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

855,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

863,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

865,Credit Suisse research shows global food inequality and waste costs up to US$13.6 trillion annually,,London,08.06.2021,"Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) published a new research report entitled ‘The global food system: Identifying sustainable solutions’, the first under new Chairman António Horta-Osório. The report examines the discrepancy in food production and waste and highlights potential solutions to reduce the estimated US$13.6 trillion annual cost.
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the global eco-system. However, at present almost 700 million people are undernourished while 40% of the world’s adult population is overweight or obese. Some studies suggest that 20% of total deaths among adults can be attributed to dietary risks. Food production, and importantly consumption, needs to change significantly in order to address these challenges. Roadblocks that need to be overcome include the need for tighter regulation and a review of the global agricultural sector.
Food production and consumption has a major environmental impact
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% of the world’s freshwater consumption (see also: Water scarcity: addressing the key challenges). The analysis suggest that the environmental footprint of the global food system is likely to worsen significantly during the next few decades unless action is taken. The likely growth in the world’s population to c10 billion by 2050 coupled with a further shift in diets, especially across the expanding emerging middle class, could increase food-related emissions by a further 46% while demand for agricultural land could increase by 49%. This is incompatible with the need to achieve a net-zero emission environment globally by 2050.
Food loss and waste needs to be addressed
The challenges associated with malnutrition and the environmental footprint could partly be addressed by targeting food loss and waste. More than 30% of food produced is either lost or wasted which meant that in 2019 cUS$408 billion of produced food went unsold or uneaten. The combined economic, environmental and social cost associated with food waste is estimated at US$2.6 trillion by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Eliminating food waste in the US and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as c50% of food loss and waste occurs during the production and handling phase while 45% takes place in the distribution and consumption phase.
Who’s most at risk from food sustainability?
The simultaneous existence of undernourishment, obesity, the environmental footprint of food production and food waste puts the global food system under significant stress. However, these factors do not impact all countries in the same way suggesting that different solutions or strategies are needed for different countries. Using the Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, we find that France, the Netherlands and Canada score best while sustainability is lowest in Russia, Bulgaria and the UAE. Sustainability challenges differ between regions: developed countries score worse on diet patterns and food waste whereas emerging countries need to address food loss and general life quality.
A change in diet is required
A change in diet towards one that is plant-based appears inevitable if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research suggest that a plant-based diet not only has a c90% lower emission intensity than that of a current average diet but that it also has the potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults by c11million. There is strong growth potential for alternative animal-protein products and the report estimates that the market for alternative meat and dairy can grow from a current size of cUS$14 billion to US$1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite the involvement of more than 600 largely small and private companies in this field, the authors expect the traditional food companies to play a key role as they steadily transition their operations towards healthier and alternative food products.
Agriculture needs to go digital
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending power and declining arable land per capita suggest that a shift in diet alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large scale adoption of new technologies. The report highlights more than 70 including vertical farming and precision agricultural solutions.
Sharing, circular-solutions, packaging and cooling help address food loss and waste
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste to create new (food) products help too. Smart packaging solutions are being developed that not only help improve production yields but importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply chain from farm to the home. The development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food even more.
Eugène Klerk, Head of Global ESG & Thematic Research at Credit Suisse, said: “New technologies will need to accompany behavioral change. A shift in diet alone will not be enough in itself to make the food system wholly sustainable. Our report thus highlights an array of technological solutions that have the potential to improve productivity, expand the product offer and crucially reduce waste. In addition, it showcases innovative companies and their pioneering technologies designed to meet the challenge.”
Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, commented: “Sustainability is a risk that companies must adequately and proactively manage. And, as other sectors before it, the food industry is going to be increasingly scrutinized by investors, consumers and regulators, pushing it to focus more on sustainable and above all, healthy food. There could be material liability risks down the road otherwise. There are also likely beneficiaries from this transition, including technology companies providing “smart-agricultural” solutions, vertical and precision farming to meet urban food demand and provide productivity yields, companies who use circular-based or smart-packaging solutions and the development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions that help extend the lifespan of food even more. But ultimately, it is really about people living a longer and more healthy life altogether, and I am convinced that investors play a significant role in catalyzing these emerging trends in how they deploy their capital.”",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/06/en/credit-suisse-research-shows-global-food-inequality-and-waste-co.html
866,Credit Suisse Americas Foundation Makes a Commitment to Wake Tech,"Raleigh, NC, May 26, 2021 – Credit Suisse, one of the world's leading financial services providers, has announced a $250,000 commitment through its Credit Suisse Americas Foundation (CSAF) to support Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech).",New York,26.05.2021,"Wake Tech is the largest community college in North Carolina. It serves more than 70,000 adults each year across six campuses and three training centers, in addition to community sites and online learning options. Credit Suisse's grant will support the college's WakeWorks® Apprenticeship program, which offers strategic pathways to future workforce opportunities by enabling young people to learn new skills, gain access to employers, and earn credentials and income while doing so. The financial support will help the program to expand beyond its existing employer-sponsored model to offer young people from the local community the opportunity to secure an apprenticeship at a broader set of employers.
This investment is part of Credit Suisse's philanthropic commitment to Future Skills, which aims to equip young people with the skills and education needed to gain meaningful employment and fulfill their potential. While continuing to partner with organizations that prioritize college completion, we are also investing in additional pathways that enable strong career starts and upward mobility. This includes career integration into K-12 and post-secondary education along with quality two-year degrees, certifications and apprenticeships. This donation continues a multi-decade commitment by the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation to empower underrepresented young people. Through this and other partnerships, Credit Suisse upholds our responsibility to be more intentional about advancing diversity, equity and inclusion, internally and externally, by leveraging our platform and resources.

""We are grateful to the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation for the gift and for their outstanding support of our college and our community,"" said Dr. Scott Ralls, President of Wake Tech Community College. ""At Wake Tech we sometimes use the phrase 'ladder economics' to refer to our college’s approach to inclusive opportunity through education, training and career development.

867,Credit Suisse sees strong future for domestic Chinese consumer brands,"The policy of ""Dual Circulation"", which will guide China's economic development for years to come, has driven an upsurge in domestic demand for Chinese consumer brands, according to Credit Suisse Securities Research analysts presenting at the 8th annual China A- Shares Conference.",Hong Kong,25.05.2021,"The Credit Suisse 8th China A-Shares Conference, taking place online from May 11-13, 2021, provides a platform for investors to explore the emerging trends in one of the world's largest and most dynamic stock markets. Participating in this year's conference are more than 70 leading A-share listed companies spanning 12 sectors including technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, industrials and autos and representing a total market capitalization of over RMB 9,147bn (USD 1,412.8bn).
Edmond Huang, Head of China/Hong Kong Securities Research, Credit Suisse, described ""Dual Circulation"" as a strategic choice to rebalance the Chinese economy away from an overreliance on external demand, provide a catalyst for unleashing domestic demand and achieve more sustainable development.
""On the supply side, China will step up technological innovation to move along the global value chain. On the demand side, it aims to boost household incomes to stimulate domestic demand,"" Mr. Huang said.
The global pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions have been two principal drivers of the ""Dual Circulation"" strategy, an inversion of China's previous strategy of globalization and trade-led growth.
The contribution to the Chinese economy from net exports is no longer as significant as it was 20 years ago, while the ageing population and growing wallets of Chinese consumers have also been a significant contributor to this new economic development model.
""Chinese brands have made remarkable progress in upgrading the quality of their products, with better aesthetics, innovation, and technology enhancements contributing to their overall enhanced appeal. They also have advantages in being able to adapt their products faster to changing consumer sentiment,"" Mr. Huang added.
This has, in turn, driven a strong sense of national pride in Chinese brands from domestic consumers. The phenomenon, known as ""China Pride"", is manifesting itself particularly for products such as sportswear, cosmetics, mobile phones and electric vehicles.
""Confidence in Chinese brands has been slowly growing for a number of years, but it accelerated through the pandemic,"" said Lei Chen, China consumer analyst with Credit Suisse's China Quantitative Insight (CQi). ""The improved product quality, marketing and distribution strategy, in addition to an increasing skepticism towards imported goods, especially foodstuffs, during Covid, have contributed to the rise of homegrown labels in China,"" Ms. Chen continued.
While the ""China Pride"" phenomenon is more pronounced among a younger generation that is largely wealthier than their parents were at the same stage in their lives, those younger consumers are also making luxury purchases earlier. This is one of the reasons why Credit Suisse analysts view this phenomenon as a long term trend for investors.
""Younger consumers are spending money earlier and are a key aspect of this ""China Pride"" idea that will become increasingly more meaningful as they mature into the next generation of older shoppers,"" Ms. Chen said.
Credit Suisse analysts expect those sectors hit hardest by Covid-19 in 2020, such travel, entertainment, cinemas and restaurants, to make a resurgence. In particular, the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 will boost sportswear and ""health conscious"" spending. But in general, Credit Suisse's analysts see this highly identifiable phenomenon of ""China Pride"" across the board – in infant formula, cosmetics and technology items, as well as in areas such as new energy vehicles and automobiles.
Sectors to watch
In the auto sector, China is expected to reduce its reliance on imported goods such as high-end luxury cars, pushing Chinese auto makers to establish high-end domestic auto brands that leverage the country's leadership in new energy and intelligent vehicle technologies, according to Bin Wang, Co- Head of APAC Autos Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
China's dominant position in electric vehicles is gathering pace, fomented by a rapidly evolving support sector. Battery prices continue to decline. Concurrently, the infrastructure to support electric vehicles, such as charging stations, are proliferating, while the rise of new entrants creates greater choices at different price points for domestic consumers.
""For the first quarter of 2021, Chinese local brands' new energy vehicles (NEV) accounted for 75.5% of total China NEV sales volume, reflecting consumer preference for Chinese branded vehicles,"" Mr. Wang said.
In the consumer sector, strong digital and marketing capabilities as well as a nimbleness to respond to consumers' changing needs, have led to strong momentum for domestic brands in sportswear, color cosmetics, skincare and infant milk formula, which have the potential to further increase market share.
Another factor contributing to ""China Pride"" as a long-term investment trend is that despite strong growth in the aforementioned sectors, Chinese brands are still underpenetrated when compared with the overall size of the market, with room for upside, according to Jesalyn Wong, China Consumer Analyst, Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
Strong and broad research coverage capabilities
Credit Suisse has one of the most comprehensive and highly recognized China Research coverage capabilities. The Credit Suisse Equity Research team covers more than 460 Chinese-listed stocks, including about 216 domestic A-shares, which represent over 70% of the CSI-300 index constituents by market capitalization.

Both series were placed to a selected group of core shareholders, institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.
The Series A MCNs have already been placed and allocated directly with such investors.
The Series B MCNs were pre-placed to such investors but are being re-offered to existing shareholders of Credit Suisse Group AG by way of an offering of preferential subscription rights (“Rights”).
The investors have entered into definitive agreements to purchase any Series B MCNs not taken up by shareholders, thereby ensuring full placement of both series of MCNs.
As discussed in our earnings release published today, our capital position remained solid with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% and a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.8% as per the end of 1Q21. However, with the Offering, we expect to further strengthen our capital position in line with our intention to achieve a CET1 ratio of approximately 13% and a minimum CET1 leverage ratio of 4%.
The MCNs will be issued by Credit Suisse Group (Guernsey) VII, Limited (the “Issuer”) on or around May 12, 2021, and will benefit from an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by Credit Suisse Group AG of amounts due under them and, on a subordinated basis, the delivery of shares on their conversion. The MCNs will be mandatorily convertible at their 6 month maturity (but subject to early conversion upon the occurrence of certain events, as well as at the option of the holder after an initial 40-day period).
The MCNs’ conversion ratio will be their CHF-denominated principal amount divided by their conversion price, which will be set at an at-the-market discount of 5.0% to the average of the volume-weighted average price of Credit Suisse Group AG’s shares on April 22 and 23, 2021. Unless converted early at the option of the holder, the Issuer will pay a fixed interest amount on the MCNs at the time of their conversion equivalent to a rate of 3.0% per annum. The Issuer will also pay a floating interest amount on the MCNs to the extent any cash dividend or cash distribution is made by Credit Suisse Group AG to its shareholders after the pricing date but prior to the relevant conversion date.
For the series B MCNs, Credit Suisse Group AG shareholders will be granted one Right for each registered share held after close of trading on April 27, 2021.

877,Credit Suisse Asset Management update on Supply Chain Finance Funds; next distribution to investors of USD 1.7 billion,"Since the four Supply Chain Finance Funds (SCFFs) were suspended on March 1, 2021, we have made progress on the wind-down of the funds.",Zurich,13.04.2021,"As at April 9, 2021 we have collected USD 2.0 billion from receivables redeemed since March 1, 2021. This results in cash and cash equivalent levels currently in the SCFFs amounting to USD 2.3 billion. The total cash position, including the USD 3.1 billion that already has been distributed to investors, thus amounts to USD 5.4 billion, or more than half of the total Assets under Management of the four funds at the time of their suspension. We are therefore able to announce a second cash distribution to investors, amounting to USD 1.7 billion, commencing today. This takes the total distribution so far to USD 4.8 billion.
Credit Suisse Asset Management continues to work on identifying and progressing options to secure recovery. Liquidation proceeds will be paid out to investors as soon as feasible in one or more instalments until the investors receive the funds’ total collected net liquidation proceeds. Investors will receive notification of such payments.
Credit Suisse Asset Management is in active dialogue with the Joint Administrators of Greensill Capital (UK) Ltd, Grant Thornton, and, where appropriate, is engaging directly with potentially delinquent obligors and other creditors. Claims will also be made under relevant insurance policies where there is evidence of non-payment or default. It is important to note that in many of these cases of non-payment or default, the obligors are firms with tangible assets. The current assessment is that there is potential for recovery in these cases although clearly there is a considerable degree of uncertainty as to the amounts that ultimately will be distributed to investors in respect of the funds. We will continue to report on the progress we are making with these situations as appropriate.
Furthermore, Credit Suisse Asset Management will consider appropriate legal actions to protect fund holders’ interests.
Outlook
We remain acutely aware of the uncertainty that the wind-down process creates for those of our clients who are invested in the funds. We are doing everything that we can to provide them with clarity, to work through issues as they arise and, ultimately, to return cash to them. We intend to provide a further update on the progress made by the end of April 2021.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/04/en/csam-supply-chain-finance-funds.html
878,Changes in the Executive Board of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG,*Ad-hoc relevant for Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG,Zurich,06.04.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG announced today that Thomas Grotzer, who previously served as General Counsel and Member of the Executive Board of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG, has been appointed interim Global Head of Compliance for the Group, effective immediately. As a result, he will step down from his role as General Counsel of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG and also from its Executive Board. His successor will be announced in due course.

879,Trading Update,,Zurich,06.04.2021,"While our financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review, we would expect to report a pre-tax loss for 1Q 2021 of approximately CHF 900 million. This includes a charge of CHF 4.4 billion in respect of the failure by a US-based hedge fund to meet its margin commitments as we announced on March 29, 2021. This will negate the very strong performance that had otherwise been achieved by our investment banking businesses and the increase in the year-on-year profits in all three of our wealth management businesses, as well as in asset management, with particular strength in our Asia Pacific division. Net new assets were positive during the quarter across our three wealth management businesses as well as in asset management and in the Swiss corporate and institutional business. 
In terms of our capital position, while this is also still subject to our usual end-period finalization and review processes, we would currently expect the 1Q 2021 CET1 ratio to be at least 12%. With regard to leverage, we expect our 1Q 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio to be at least 5.4% and our 1Q 2021 CET1 leverage ratio to be at least 3.7%. Following the completion of share buybacks in 1Q 2021, we have suspended the share buyback program and we do not intend to resume share purchases before we have regained our target capital ratios and restored our dividend. As of the end of 1Q21, our liquidity position remains strong with HQLA balances expected to exceed USD 200 billion and the Group liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) expected to exceed 200%.
With regard to the four supply chain finance funds, where we continue to see cash inflows, we will distribute a separate update on further repayments within the next few days.
We acknowledge that both the US hedge fund and the supply chain finance fund matters require substantial further review and scrutiny. The Board of Directors has launched investigations into both of these matters which will not only focus on the direct issues arising from each of them, but also reflect on the broader consequences and lessons learned. We have also undertaken senior management changes within the Investment Bank division and within the Risk and Compliance organization as separately announced today. 
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group said: ""The significant loss in our Prime Services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable. In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders. Together with the Board of Directors, we are fully committed to addressing these situations. Serious lessons will be learned. Credit Suisse remains a formidable institution with a rich history.""
Our 1Q 2021 financial results will be published on April 22, 2021.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/04/en/trading-update.html

Before joining Credit Suisse, he was UBS’s General Counsel for APAC Wealth Management, based in Hong Kong.
All three will report to Thomas Gottstein.
Further Actions by the Board of Directors
In March 2021, the tactical crisis committee of the Board of Directors consisting of the Chairman, the Chairs of the Audit Committee and Risk Committee and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee was activated to exercise close oversight and ensure timely decision making with respect to the resolution of the issues in connection with the Credit Suisse Asset Management managed supply chain finance funds. The mandate of this committee has in the meanwhile been expanded to include the significant US-based hedge fund matter. The tactical crisis committee works closely with the CEO and the rest of the management team.
The Board of Directors has launched two investigations, to be carried out by external parties, into the supply chain finance funds matter and into the significant US-based hedge fund matter. These investigations will be supervised by a special committee of the Board of Directors and will not only focus on the direct issues arising from those matters, but also reflect on the broader consequences and lessons learned.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/04/en/bod-announcement.html

Following the failure of the fund to meet these margin commitments, Credit Suisse and a number of other banks are in the process of exiting these positions. While at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results, notwithstanding the positive trends announced in our trading statement earlier this month.

882,10th Credit Suisse Emerging Consumer Survey 2021,,Hong Kong,25.03.2021,"The tenth edition of Emerging Markets Consumer Survey was launched by the Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) today at the 24th Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong.
This year’s Emerging Consumer Survey shows three main overarching themes spanning the eight survey countries: 1) growth in the digital economy from online retail leading to an increase in online education; 2) the adoption of healthier lifestyles and increased environmental awareness; and 3) a level of pent-up demand for discretionary purchases. With vaccines rolling out globally, forward looking sentiment indicators suggest an improvement in both confidence and income expectations, particularly in Asia. India and China top the Credit Suisse Emerging Consumer Scorecard.
Key themes by surveyed country
China: The rise of e-grocery, the growing popularity of online games and the increased acceptance of online education services. Other trends include increasing health consciousness, an increase in the purchase of sportswear and cosmetics demand.
India: Optimistic about personal finances with a growing appetite for large discretionary purchases and higher consumption growth. Consumer digital adoption is rising rapidly, particularly in banking, shopping and entertainment.
 Indonesia: While consumers expect to have higher incomes, there is hesitancy toward larger discretionary purchases. That said, there is pent-up demand for fashion apparel. Digital adoption has also accelerated.
Thailand: Weak consumption environment and cautious consumer outlook, but an increase in purchase intentions due to pent-up demand. Growth in online activity and environmental considerations taken into account when spending.
Turkey: Increased consumer confidence with strong prospects for wellbeing, hygiene and e-commerce. Consumers inclined to spend more for a better quality of life since the pandemic.
Brazil: Improvement in income and a change in consumption patterns, including an increase in spending on beer and take-away meals. Timing and scope of the economy’s re-opening are highly uncertain.
Mexico: Increasing digital economy driven by mobile, food and online grocery delivery. Intention to buy consumer discretionary items, but households expect income to return slowly.
The survey reveals that many of the behavioral changes observed through the pandemic have accelerated trends that were already in play rather than ones that will swiftly reverse. In most categories, it is again the young, urban and wealthy demographic that is driving consumer growth and preferences in emerging markets.
Environmental concerns and sustainable consumption
Environmental concerns have been rising steadily and consumers in developing countries appear more at risk than those in developed regions because of the impact of extreme heat, flooding and droughts on their daily lives. On a global level, the survey provided strong evidence that environmental concerns do influence emerging markets consumer spending behavior, but equally, that income levels do not matter significantly in relation to environmental concerns.
There is a higher-income bias toward changing spending behavior due to environmental concerns in six of the eight countries surveyed; however, the difference with consumers on lower income levels is relatively small. Consumers in India, Thailand and China appear to be influenced most, whereas Russian consumers appear less affected by environmental issues with close to 50% saying that their spending is not influenced at all.
The perception appears to be that the ‘environmental agenda’ is driven more by younger consumers than by their parents. When reviewing the survey results by age group, however, there is a lack of significant evidence for this view as consumers aged 46 and older are influenced almost equally by environmental considerations as consumers aged 18–29.
Change in consumption
While the survey showed that there is considerable support to address the issue of single-use plastics, there is also a significant share of consumers (around 40% or more in most countries) who are becoming increasingly concerned about gasoline and diesel-powered cars.
The survey results clearly show that consumers have started to eat healthier food and that younger consumers on the whole have increased their spending on sports items since the start of the pandemic. This combination does suggest that emerging markets consumers in most countries, particularly China, Indonesia and Turkey, have adopted a greater focus on a more sustainable and healthy lifestyles.
Digital consumers
The survey suggests that, as economies re-open and ‘normalize,’ it is highly likely that several aspects of life that have become more digitalized will remain so, notably when it comes to communication, shopping, entertainment, healthcare and education.
E-commerce saw tremendous growth in 2020 with online sales up by 80% versus 2019. Improving technology, logistics and payment systems have allowed billions of consumers to ‘shop’ anytime and from anywhere, rather than go shopping physically. Most survey participants in all countries (except for Russia) increased the amount of grocery shopping online due to the pandemic with older consumers in Asia keener to shift to the internet to buy their groceries compared to other emerging economies.
The pandemic drove Ed-Tech to become a more prominent feature of education worldwide. The survey shows that the majority of consumers increased their use of online education with Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey being notable consumers. Looking ahead, the trend looks set to increase further, especially in Asia – China, India and Thailand.
Optimism improving supported by rising incomes and high savings ratios
Changing in consumer spending habits may be supported via greater savings. 2020 saw a sharp rise in savings ratios due to a closure of spending avenues. With incomes now expected to recover and economies re-opening, a net third of respondents see their personal finances improving in the first half of 2021, with the major Asian economies leading the way. There is a degree of pent up demand for discretionary goods and services, if not necessarily major big ticket purchases.
Richard Kersley, Head of Research Product, Securities Research at Credit Suisse said: “Following an unprecedented year disrupted by the global pandemic, our survey shows the global lockdowns appear to have expedited nascent structural trends, which seem unlikely to reverse with the decline of COVID-19. Nevertheless, we believe the emerging consumer is still on track to play a key role in tomorrow’s world. In our view, the pandemic has delayed, but not derailed the growth-rebalancing act between developed and emerging markets. Key structural factors such as young and dynamic demographics, higher urbanization and the rise of a growing consumer middle-class will support higher growth in emerging economies. However, it will probably take a few years before emerging countries revert to their pre-pandemic growth trends.”
Credit Suisse again partnered with global market research firm Nielsen to conduct the Emerging Consumer Survey, which comprises more than 14,000 respondents. Unlike previous editions of this survey, the polling was all conducted online and therefore care needs to be undertaken when making comparisons with the results from previous surveys, which employed face to face interviews. The survey focuses on the eight countries of Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Thailand and Turkey, representing 3.7 billion people and USD 15.42 trillion of final consumption. The data and analysis is proprietary to Credit Suisse.

884,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.

886,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

889,Credit Suisse celebrates the 25th year of the Asian Investment Conference as it explores the road ahead for the region over the next quarter century,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) welcomes more than 3,000 attendees for a four-day conference commencing today. The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

Electric vehicles (EV) value chain, how cost inflation impacts the EV market;

893,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

897,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
900,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

910,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

912,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

921,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

929,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

931,Credit Suisse research shows global food inequality and waste costs up to US$13.6 trillion annually,,London,08.06.2021,"Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) published a new research report entitled ‘The global food system: Identifying sustainable solutions’, the first under new Chairman António Horta-Osório. The report examines the discrepancy in food production and waste and highlights potential solutions to reduce the estimated US$13.6 trillion annual cost.
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the global eco-system. However, at present almost 700 million people are undernourished while 40% of the world’s adult population is overweight or obese. Some studies suggest that 20% of total deaths among adults can be attributed to dietary risks. Food production, and importantly consumption, needs to change significantly in order to address these challenges. Roadblocks that need to be overcome include the need for tighter regulation and a review of the global agricultural sector.
Food production and consumption has a major environmental impact
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% of the world’s freshwater consumption (see also: Water scarcity: addressing the key challenges). The analysis suggest that the environmental footprint of the global food system is likely to worsen significantly during the next few decades unless action is taken. The likely growth in the world’s population to c10 billion by 2050 coupled with a further shift in diets, especially across the expanding emerging middle class, could increase food-related emissions by a further 46% while demand for agricultural land could increase by 49%. This is incompatible with the need to achieve a net-zero emission environment globally by 2050.
Food loss and waste needs to be addressed
The challenges associated with malnutrition and the environmental footprint could partly be addressed by targeting food loss and waste. More than 30% of food produced is either lost or wasted which meant that in 2019 cUS$408 billion of produced food went unsold or uneaten. The combined economic, environmental and social cost associated with food waste is estimated at US$2.6 trillion by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Eliminating food waste in the US and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as c50% of food loss and waste occurs during the production and handling phase while 45% takes place in the distribution and consumption phase.
Who’s most at risk from food sustainability?
The simultaneous existence of undernourishment, obesity, the environmental footprint of food production and food waste puts the global food system under significant stress. However, these factors do not impact all countries in the same way suggesting that different solutions or strategies are needed for different countries. Using the Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, we find that France, the Netherlands and Canada score best while sustainability is lowest in Russia, Bulgaria and the UAE. Sustainability challenges differ between regions: developed countries score worse on diet patterns and food waste whereas emerging countries need to address food loss and general life quality.
A change in diet is required
A change in diet towards one that is plant-based appears inevitable if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research suggest that a plant-based diet not only has a c90% lower emission intensity than that of a current average diet but that it also has the potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults by c11million. There is strong growth potential for alternative animal-protein products and the report estimates that the market for alternative meat and dairy can grow from a current size of cUS$14 billion to US$1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite the involvement of more than 600 largely small and private companies in this field, the authors expect the traditional food companies to play a key role as they steadily transition their operations towards healthier and alternative food products.
Agriculture needs to go digital
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending power and declining arable land per capita suggest that a shift in diet alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large scale adoption of new technologies. The report highlights more than 70 including vertical farming and precision agricultural solutions.
Sharing, circular-solutions, packaging and cooling help address food loss and waste
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste to create new (food) products help too. Smart packaging solutions are being developed that not only help improve production yields but importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply chain from farm to the home. The development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food even more.
Eugène Klerk, Head of Global ESG & Thematic Research at Credit Suisse, said: “New technologies will need to accompany behavioral change. A shift in diet alone will not be enough in itself to make the food system wholly sustainable. Our report thus highlights an array of technological solutions that have the potential to improve productivity, expand the product offer and crucially reduce waste. In addition, it showcases innovative companies and their pioneering technologies designed to meet the challenge.”
Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, commented: “Sustainability is a risk that companies must adequately and proactively manage. And, as other sectors before it, the food industry is going to be increasingly scrutinized by investors, consumers and regulators, pushing it to focus more on sustainable and above all, healthy food. There could be material liability risks down the road otherwise. There are also likely beneficiaries from this transition, including technology companies providing “smart-agricultural” solutions, vertical and precision farming to meet urban food demand and provide productivity yields, companies who use circular-based or smart-packaging solutions and the development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions that help extend the lifespan of food even more. But ultimately, it is really about people living a longer and more healthy life altogether, and I am convinced that investors play a significant role in catalyzing these emerging trends in how they deploy their capital.”",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/06/en/credit-suisse-research-shows-global-food-inequality-and-waste-co.html
932,Credit Suisse Americas Foundation Makes a Commitment to Wake Tech,"Raleigh, NC, May 26, 2021 – Credit Suisse, one of the world's leading financial services providers, has announced a $250,000 commitment through its Credit Suisse Americas Foundation (CSAF) to support Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech).",New York,26.05.2021,"Wake Tech is the largest community college in North Carolina. It serves more than 70,000 adults each year across six campuses and three training centers, in addition to community sites and online learning options. Credit Suisse's grant will support the college's WakeWorks® Apprenticeship program, which offers strategic pathways to future workforce opportunities by enabling young people to learn new skills, gain access to employers, and earn credentials and income while doing so. The financial support will help the program to expand beyond its existing employer-sponsored model to offer young people from the local community the opportunity to secure an apprenticeship at a broader set of employers.
This investment is part of Credit Suisse's philanthropic commitment to Future Skills, which aims to equip young people with the skills and education needed to gain meaningful employment and fulfill their potential. While continuing to partner with organizations that prioritize college completion, we are also investing in additional pathways that enable strong career starts and upward mobility. This includes career integration into K-12 and post-secondary education along with quality two-year degrees, certifications and apprenticeships. This donation continues a multi-decade commitment by the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation to empower underrepresented young people.

933,Credit Suisse sees strong future for domestic Chinese consumer brands,"The policy of ""Dual Circulation"", which will guide China's economic development for years to come, has driven an upsurge in domestic demand for Chinese consumer brands, according to Credit Suisse Securities Research analysts presenting at the 8th annual China A- Shares Conference.",Hong Kong,25.05.2021,"The Credit Suisse 8th China A-Shares Conference, taking place online from May 11-13, 2021, provides a platform for investors to explore the emerging trends in one of the world's largest and most dynamic stock markets. Participating in this year's conference are more than 70 leading A-share listed companies spanning 12 sectors including technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, industrials and autos and representing a total market capitalization of over RMB 9,147bn (USD 1,412.8bn).
Edmond Huang, Head of China/Hong Kong Securities Research, Credit Suisse, described ""Dual Circulation"" as a strategic choice to rebalance the Chinese economy away from an overreliance on external demand, provide a catalyst for unleashing domestic demand and achieve more sustainable development.
""On the supply side, China will step up technological innovation to move along the global value chain. On the demand side, it aims to boost household incomes to stimulate domestic demand,"" Mr. Huang said.
The global pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions have been two principal drivers of the ""Dual Circulation"" strategy, an inversion of China's previous strategy of globalization and trade-led growth.
The contribution to the Chinese economy from net exports is no longer as significant as it was 20 years ago, while the ageing population and growing wallets of Chinese consumers have also been a significant contributor to this new economic development model.
""Chinese brands have made remarkable progress in upgrading the quality of their products, with better aesthetics, innovation, and technology enhancements contributing to their overall enhanced appeal. They also have advantages in being able to adapt their products faster to changing consumer sentiment,"" Mr. Huang added.
This has, in turn, driven a strong sense of national pride in Chinese brands from domestic consumers. The phenomenon, known as ""China Pride"", is manifesting itself particularly for products such as sportswear, cosmetics, mobile phones and electric vehicles.
""Confidence in Chinese brands has been slowly growing for a number of years, but it accelerated through the pandemic,"" said Lei Chen, China consumer analyst with Credit Suisse's China Quantitative Insight (CQi). ""The improved product quality, marketing and distribution strategy, in addition to an increasing skepticism towards imported goods, especially foodstuffs, during Covid, have contributed to the rise of homegrown labels in China,"" Ms. Chen continued.
While the ""China Pride"" phenomenon is more pronounced among a younger generation that is largely wealthier than their parents were at the same stage in their lives, those younger consumers are also making luxury purchases earlier. This is one of the reasons why Credit Suisse analysts view this phenomenon as a long term trend for investors.
""Younger consumers are spending money earlier and are a key aspect of this ""China Pride"" idea that will become increasingly more meaningful as they mature into the next generation of older shoppers,"" Ms. Chen said.
Credit Suisse analysts expect those sectors hit hardest by Covid-19 in 2020, such travel, entertainment, cinemas and restaurants, to make a resurgence. In particular, the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 will boost sportswear and ""health conscious"" spending. But in general, Credit Suisse's analysts see this highly identifiable phenomenon of ""China Pride"" across the board – in infant formula, cosmetics and technology items, as well as in areas such as new energy vehicles and automobiles.
Sectors to watch
In the auto sector, China is expected to reduce its reliance on imported goods such as high-end luxury cars, pushing Chinese auto makers to establish high-end domestic auto brands that leverage the country's leadership in new energy and intelligent vehicle technologies, according to Bin Wang, Co- Head of APAC Autos Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
China's dominant position in electric vehicles is gathering pace, fomented by a rapidly evolving support sector. Battery prices continue to decline. Concurrently, the infrastructure to support electric vehicles, such as charging stations, are proliferating, while the rise of new entrants creates greater choices at different price points for domestic consumers.
""For the first quarter of 2021, Chinese local brands' new energy vehicles (NEV) accounted for 75.5% of total China NEV sales volume, reflecting consumer preference for Chinese branded vehicles,"" Mr. Wang said.
In the consumer sector, strong digital and marketing capabilities as well as a nimbleness to respond to consumers' changing needs, have led to strong momentum for domestic brands in sportswear, color cosmetics, skincare and infant milk formula, which have the potential to further increase market share.
Another factor contributing to ""China Pride"" as a long-term investment trend is that despite strong growth in the aforementioned sectors, Chinese brands are still underpenetrated when compared with the overall size of the market, with room for upside, according to Jesalyn Wong, China Consumer Analyst, Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
Strong and broad research coverage capabilities
Credit Suisse has one of the most comprehensive and highly recognized China Research coverage capabilities. The Credit Suisse Equity Research team covers more than 460 Chinese-listed stocks, including about 216 domestic A-shares, which represent over 70% of the CSI-300 index constituents by market capitalization.

Both series were placed to a selected group of core shareholders, institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.
The Series A MCNs have already been placed and allocated directly with such investors.
The Series B MCNs were pre-placed to such investors but are being re-offered to existing shareholders of Credit Suisse Group AG by way of an offering of preferential subscription rights (“Rights”).
The investors have entered into definitive agreements to purchase any Series B MCNs not taken up by shareholders, thereby ensuring full placement of both series of MCNs.
As discussed in our earnings release published today, our capital position remained solid with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% and a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.8% as per the end of 1Q21. However, with the Offering, we expect to further strengthen our capital position in line with our intention to achieve a CET1 ratio of approximately 13% and a minimum CET1 leverage ratio of 4%.
The MCNs will be issued by Credit Suisse Group (Guernsey) VII, Limited (the “Issuer”) on or around May 12, 2021, and will benefit from an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by Credit Suisse Group AG of amounts due under them and, on a subordinated basis, the delivery of shares on their conversion. The MCNs will be mandatorily convertible at their 6 month maturity (but subject to early conversion upon the occurrence of certain events, as well as at the option of the holder after an initial 40-day period).
The MCNs’ conversion ratio will be their CHF-denominated principal amount divided by their conversion price, which will be set at an at-the-market discount of 5.0% to the average of the volume-weighted average price of Credit Suisse Group AG’s shares on April 22 and 23, 2021. Unless converted early at the option of the holder, the Issuer will pay a fixed interest amount on the MCNs at the time of their conversion equivalent to a rate of 3.0% per annum. The Issuer will also pay a floating interest amount on the MCNs to the extent any cash dividend or cash distribution is made by Credit Suisse Group AG to its shareholders after the pricing date but prior to the relevant conversion date.
For the series B MCNs, Credit Suisse Group AG shareholders will be granted one Right for each registered share held after close of trading on April 27, 2021.

It is important to note that in many of these cases of non-payment or default, the obligors are firms with tangible assets. The current assessment is that there is potential for recovery in these cases although clearly there is a considerable degree of uncertainty as to the amounts that ultimately will be distributed to investors in respect of the funds. We will continue to report on the progress we are making with these situations as appropriate.
Furthermore, Credit Suisse Asset Management will consider appropriate legal actions to protect fund holders’ interests.
Outlook
We remain acutely aware of the uncertainty that the wind-down process creates for those of our clients who are invested in the funds. We are doing everything that we can to provide them with clarity, to work through issues as they arise and, ultimately, to return cash to them. We intend to provide a further update on the progress made by the end of April 2021.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/04/en/csam-supply-chain-finance-funds.html
944,Changes in the Executive Board of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG,*Ad-hoc relevant for Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG,Zurich,06.04.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG announced today that Thomas Grotzer, who previously served as General Counsel and Member of the Executive Board of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG, has been appointed interim Global Head of Compliance for the Group, effective immediately. As a result, he will step down from his role as General Counsel of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG and also from its Executive Board. His successor will be announced in due course.

945,Trading Update,,Zurich,06.04.2021,"While our financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review, we would expect to report a pre-tax loss for 1Q 2021 of approximately CHF 900 million. This includes a charge of CHF 4.4 billion in respect of the failure by a US-based hedge fund to meet its margin commitments as we announced on March 29, 2021. This will negate the very strong performance that had otherwise been achieved by our investment banking businesses and the increase in the year-on-year profits in all three of our wealth management businesses, as well as in asset management, with particular strength in our Asia Pacific division. Net new assets were positive during the quarter across our three wealth management businesses as well as in asset management and in the Swiss corporate and institutional business. 
In terms of our capital position, while this is also still subject to our usual end-period finalization and review processes, we would currently expect the 1Q 2021 CET1 ratio to be at least 12%. With regard to leverage, we expect our 1Q 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio to be at least 5.4% and our 1Q 2021 CET1 leverage ratio to be at least 3.7%. Following the completion of share buybacks in 1Q 2021, we have suspended the share buyback program and we do not intend to resume share purchases before we have regained our target capital ratios and restored our dividend. As of the end of 1Q21, our liquidity position remains strong with HQLA balances expected to exceed USD 200 billion and the Group liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) expected to exceed 200%.
With regard to the four supply chain finance funds, where we continue to see cash inflows, we will distribute a separate update on further repayments within the next few days.
We acknowledge that both the US hedge fund and the supply chain finance fund matters require substantial further review and scrutiny. The Board of Directors has launched investigations into both of these matters which will not only focus on the direct issues arising from each of them, but also reflect on the broader consequences and lessons learned. We have also undertaken senior management changes within the Investment Bank division and within the Risk and Compliance organization as separately announced today. 
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group said: ""The significant loss in our Prime Services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable. In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders. Together with the Board of Directors, we are fully committed to addressing these situations. Serious lessons will be learned. Credit Suisse remains a formidable institution with a rich history.""
Our 1Q 2021 financial results will be published on April 22, 2021.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/04/en/trading-update.html

Following the failure of the fund to meet these margin commitments, Credit Suisse and a number of other banks are in the process of exiting these positions.

948,10th Credit Suisse Emerging Consumer Survey 2021,,Hong Kong,25.03.2021,"The tenth edition of Emerging Markets Consumer Survey was launched by the Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) today at the 24th Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong.
This year’s Emerging Consumer Survey shows three main overarching themes spanning the eight survey countries: 1) growth in the digital economy from online retail leading to an increase in online education; 2) the adoption of healthier lifestyles and increased environmental awareness; and 3) a level of pent-up demand for discretionary purchases. With vaccines rolling out globally, forward looking sentiment indicators suggest an improvement in both confidence and income expectations, particularly in Asia. India and China top the Credit Suisse Emerging Consumer Scorecard.
Key themes by surveyed country
China: The rise of e-grocery, the growing popularity of online games and the increased acceptance of online education services. Other trends include increasing health consciousness, an increase in the purchase of sportswear and cosmetics demand.
India: Optimistic about personal finances with a growing appetite for large discretionary purchases and higher consumption growth. Consumer digital adoption is rising rapidly, particularly in banking, shopping and entertainment.
 Indonesia: While consumers expect to have higher incomes, there is hesitancy toward larger discretionary purchases. That said, there is pent-up demand for fashion apparel. Digital adoption has also accelerated.
Thailand: Weak consumption environment and cautious consumer outlook, but an increase in purchase intentions due to pent-up demand. Growth in online activity and environmental considerations taken into account when spending.
Turkey: Increased consumer confidence with strong prospects for wellbeing, hygiene and e-commerce. Consumers inclined to spend more for a better quality of life since the pandemic.
Brazil: Improvement in income and a change in consumption patterns, including an increase in spending on beer and take-away meals. Timing and scope of the economy’s re-opening are highly uncertain.
Mexico: Increasing digital economy driven by mobile, food and online grocery delivery. Intention to buy consumer discretionary items, but households expect income to return slowly.
The survey reveals that many of the behavioral changes observed through the pandemic have accelerated trends that were already in play rather than ones that will swiftly reverse. In most categories, it is again the young, urban and wealthy demographic that is driving consumer growth and preferences in emerging markets.
Environmental concerns and sustainable consumption
Environmental concerns have been rising steadily and consumers in developing countries appear more at risk than those in developed regions because of the impact of extreme heat, flooding and droughts on their daily lives. On a global level, the survey provided strong evidence that environmental concerns do influence emerging markets consumer spending behavior, but equally, that income levels do not matter significantly in relation to environmental concerns.
There is a higher-income bias toward changing spending behavior due to environmental concerns in six of the eight countries surveyed; however, the difference with consumers on lower income levels is relatively small. Consumers in India, Thailand and China appear to be influenced most, whereas Russian consumers appear less affected by environmental issues with close to 50% saying that their spending is not influenced at all.
The perception appears to be that the ‘environmental agenda’ is driven more by younger consumers than by their parents. When reviewing the survey results by age group, however, there is a lack of significant evidence for this view as consumers aged 46 and older are influenced almost equally by environmental considerations as consumers aged 18–29.
Change in consumption
While the survey showed that there is considerable support to address the issue of single-use plastics, there is also a significant share of consumers (around 40% or more in most countries) who are becoming increasingly concerned about gasoline and diesel-powered cars.
The survey results clearly show that consumers have started to eat healthier food and that younger consumers on the whole have increased their spending on sports items since the start of the pandemic. This combination does suggest that emerging markets consumers in most countries, particularly China, Indonesia and Turkey, have adopted a greater focus on a more sustainable and healthy lifestyles.
Digital consumers
The survey suggests that, as economies re-open and ‘normalize,’ it is highly likely that several aspects of life that have become more digitalized will remain so, notably when it comes to communication, shopping, entertainment, healthcare and education.
E-commerce saw tremendous growth in 2020 with online sales up by 80% versus 2019. Improving technology, logistics and payment systems have allowed billions of consumers to ‘shop’ anytime and from anywhere, rather than go shopping physically. Most survey participants in all countries (except for Russia) increased the amount of grocery shopping online due to the pandemic with older consumers in Asia keener to shift to the internet to buy their groceries compared to other emerging economies.
The pandemic drove Ed-Tech to become a more prominent feature of education worldwide. The survey shows that the majority of consumers increased their use of online education with Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey being notable consumers. Looking ahead, the trend looks set to increase further, especially in Asia – China, India and Thailand.
Optimism improving supported by rising incomes and high savings ratios
Changing in consumer spending habits may be supported via greater savings. 2020 saw a sharp rise in savings ratios due to a closure of spending avenues. With incomes now expected to recover and economies re-opening, a net third of respondents see their personal finances improving in the first half of 2021, with the major Asian economies leading the way. There is a degree of pent up demand for discretionary goods and services, if not necessarily major big ticket purchases.
Richard Kersley, Head of Research Product, Securities Research at Credit Suisse said: “Following an unprecedented year disrupted by the global pandemic, our survey shows the global lockdowns appear to have expedited nascent structural trends, which seem unlikely to reverse with the decline of COVID-19. Nevertheless, we believe the emerging consumer is still on track to play a key role in tomorrow’s world. In our view, the pandemic has delayed, but not derailed the growth-rebalancing act between developed and emerging markets. Key structural factors such as young and dynamic demographics, higher urbanization and the rise of a growing consumer middle-class will support higher growth in emerging economies. However, it will probably take a few years before emerging countries revert to their pre-pandemic growth trends.”
Credit Suisse again partnered with global market research firm Nielsen to conduct the Emerging Consumer Survey, which comprises more than 14,000 respondents. Unlike previous editions of this survey, the polling was all conducted online and therefore care needs to be undertaken when making comparisons with the results from previous surveys, which employed face to face interviews. The survey focuses on the eight countries of Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Thailand and Turkey, representing 3.7 billion people and USD 15.42 trillion of final consumption. The data and analysis is proprietary to Credit Suisse.

951,Trading Update,"Thomas Gottstein, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse, is due to present at the annual Morgan Stanley European Financials Conference today.",Zurich,16.03.2021,"Ahead of that, Credit Suisse issues the following update prior to entering the close of the period for its first quarter results on March 31, 2021, which are scheduled to be announced on April 22, 2021.
At our 4Q20 results announcement on February 18, 2021, we noted in our outlook statement that Credit Suisse has seen a strong start to 2021. This has continued over the last month, with the Group achieving the highest level of income before taxes in both January and February in a decade. Our Investment Bank division is benefitting from a particularly strong performance in capital markets issuance activity and from a continued good performance across sales & trading, with overall Investment Bank year-to-date revenues up over 50% compared to the same period last year. Increased YoY client activity is also benefitting all three of our Wealth Management-related businesses, led by growth in Global Trading Solutions (GTS), and with particular strength in the Asia Pacific division, while sequentially net interest income is stabilizing and recurring commissions and fees continue to trend up. Notwithstanding the continued COVID-19 pandemic, our credit loss experience remains benign, with signs of improvement in the global economy beginning to benefit allowance for credit losses under the current expected credit loss (CECL) accounting methodology.
With regard to the suspension and liquidation of the supply chain finance funds (with an aggregate net asset value of approximately USD 10 billion as published in late February 2021) managed by Credit Suisse Asset Management (CSAM) with assets originated and structured by Greensill Capital, Credit Suisse’s priority remains the recovery of funds for CSAM’s investors. CSAM are working closely with the administrators of Greensill Capital, Grant Thornton, and with other parties to facilitate this process. Initial redemption repayments totalling USD 3.1 billion across the four funds have been made beginning on March 8, 2021. The funds’ management companies intend to announce further cash distributions over the coming months, and we will update fund investors accordingly. With respect to the collateralized USD 140 million bridge loan made by Credit Suisse to Greensill Capital last year, USD 50 million has been recently repaid by the administrators of Greensill Capital, reducing the outstanding collateralized loan to USD 90 million. While these issues are still at an early stage, we would note that it is possible that Credit Suisse will incur a charge in respect of these matters.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/03/en/trading-update.html

As announced on March 30, 2022, the answers provided to Ethos Foundation are publicly available at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/04/en/cs-publishes-answers-to-ethos-foundation-information-request.html
953,Credit Suisse publishes agenda for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,30.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), which will take place on April 29, 2022. As previously communicated, this year’s AGM will be held without the personal attendance of shareholders.
Credit Suisse invites shareholders to join the AGM through a live webcast that will be broadcast on www.credit-suisse.com/agm. Shareholders are requested to vote in advance by giving a power of attorney and voting instructions to the independent proxy. The respective deadline is April 26, 2022. The voting results will be published on www.credit-suisse.com/agm shortly after the AGM. Shareholders can submit questions ahead of the AGM via an online speakers’ desk, which will remain open until April 26, 2022.
The agenda for the 2022 AGM, published today by the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (Board), includes but is not limited to:
Proposal on discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding discharge in relation to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter.
Proposal for a distribution of a dividend to shareholders of CHF 0.10 per share for the financial year 2021.
Creation of authorized capital.
Proposal for the election of Axel P. Lehmann as Chairman of the Board as well as the election of three new non-executive members of the Board, Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board, as well as a consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets).
The invitation and agenda for the 2022 AGM are available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm.
Discharge of the members of the Board and Executive Board for the 2020 and 2021 financial year, excluding the SCFF matter
The Board proposes that the members of the Board and the Executive Board be granted discharge for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, excluding all issues related to the SCFF matter. As a result of the Archegos and SCFF matters, the Board withdrew its proposal on the discharge of the members of the Board and the Executive Board for the 2020 financial year from the 2021 AGM agenda. The proposal was to be considered once the investigations into the two matters were completed. The investigation into both matters has been completed and the report relating to the Archegos matter was published. However, due to the ongoing process to recover investors’ funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the Board does not intend to publish the related report. It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.
Dividend distribution
As previously announced, the Board will propose to shareholders that a total cash dividend of CHF 0.10 per share be distributed for the financial year 2021. This is consistent with the reduced dividend paid for the financial year 2020, and we believe it reflects a prudent capital distribution approach for a challenging year.
Creation of authorized capital
Consistent with past practice, the Board proposes to reintroduce authorized share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 5 million (equivalent to 125,000,000 registered shares) in order to preserve strategic and financial flexibility, including for a further development of business activities, and ensure a sufficient reserve of authorized capital, in line with regulatory expectations.
Changes to the Board
As previously announced, the Board is proposing Axel P. Lehmann for election as Chairman of the Board, and Mirko Bianchi, Keyu Jin and Amanda Norton for election as non-executive members of the Board, for a term until the end of the next AGM, with Amanda Norton joining the Board on July 1, 2022. The appointment of these three non-executive members of the Board is subject to regulatory approval.
Severin Schwan, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas will not stand for re-election at the AGM.
All other members of the Board will stand for re-election for a further term of office of one year.
Approval of the compensation of the Board and the Executive Board and consultative vote on the 2021 Compensation Report
In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations, shareholders will vote separately, and with binding effect, on the overall compensation of the Board and the Executive Board at the AGM. The Board proposes that shareholders approve a maximum aggregate compensation for the Board of CHF 13.0 million for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote.
The Board further proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 8.6 million for short-term variable incentive compensation for the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year in a retrospective vote and the maximum aggregate amount of CHF 34.0 million of fixed compensation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM in a prospective vote. The Board also proposes that shareholders approve the aggregate amount of CHF 12.1 million for share-based replacement awards for new Executive Board members who joined the bank in 2022.
Consistent with the practice in prior years, the 2021 Compensation Report, which is part of Credit Suisse Group AG’s Annual Report, will be presented to shareholders for a consultative vote.
Shareholder proposal for a special audit
In March 2022, the Board received a proposal from Ethos Foundation and other shareholders requesting information and that a special audit be conducted in connection with the SCFF and the “Suisse Secrets” (also referred to as “Swiss Leaks”) matters. The Board has responded to the request for information with answers, which will be available on the Credit Suisse website at: www.credit-suisse.com/agm in the week of April 4, 2022. In light of the ongoing recovery processes in the SCFF matter, as well as legal and regulatory complexities, the Board believes that a special audit would, at this stage, be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should not approve this specific proposal.
Shareholder proposal for an amendment of the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG relating to the bank’s climate change strategy and disclosures (fossil fuel assets)
The Board has received a shareholder proposal from Ethos Foundation and ShareAction on behalf of 11 institutional investors relating to Credit Suisse’s climate change strategy and disclosures. The specific focus of the proposal is on alignment, disclosure and reporting in relation to the oil, gas and coal sectors. The request proposes that the Articles of Association of Credit Suisse Group AG be amended to include a new article. While the Board agrees with the objectives of this proposal, it does not believe that these additional disclosures should be effectuated by means of an amendment to the Articles of Association of the bank. The Board has already resolved to include the additional disclosures requested in the shareholder proposal in Credit Suisse’s 2022 Sustainability Report (or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosures) and to submit the 2022 Sustainability Report (or TCFD disclosures) for a consultative vote to shareholders at the 2023 AGM. In addition, Credit Suisse has decided to introduce new restrictions related to the financing of oil sands, deep-sea mining and Arctic oil and gas. Furthermore, due to newly introduced Swiss law reporting obligations on non-financial matters, which go into effect for the 2023 financial year, the Board intends to propose the required changes to the Articles of Association at the 2023 AGM. The Board therefore recommends that shareholders should vote against this proposal.
1Q22 Earnings Release
Credit Suisse expects to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 on April 27, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/agm-2022-invitation.html
954,Decision by a Court in Bermuda,,Zurich,29.03.2022,"Credit Suisse Group takes note of the Bermuda Supreme Court’s judgment against a local life insurance subsidiary of Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Life Bermuda, and refers to its press release of March 23, 2022.
The judgment relates to life insurance policies of one client of Credit Suisse Life Bermuda. The life insurance subsidiary has been closed to new business and in wind-down for more than seven years and has no other material business that will be affected by this judgment.
The judgment is not yet final and is subject to appeal, which Credit Suisse Life Bermuda intends to vigorously pursue.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/decision-court-bermuda.html
955,Credit Suisse acts as Sole Conservation Bond Structurer on World Bank's 'Rhino Bond',,London,24.03.2022,"This is a financial promotion - investments in this bond will put capital at risk if not held to maturity.
Credit Suisse is pleased to announce the pricing of the World Bank's Wildlife Conservation Bond (WCB), also known as the 'Rhino Bond', raising USD 150 mn for sustainable development projects and approximately USD 10 mn (ZAR 152 mn) directed towards conservation efforts in South Africa. The bank acted as sole conservation bond structurer and a joint bookrunner on this new type of bond that has a maturity of 5 years.
The WCB, which priced yesterday, is a first-of-its-kind structure that has the potential to shift the conservation funding model, harnessing donor funds in a blended finance approach to mobilize private sector funding through traditional debt capital markets.
The bond supports conservation finance through an outcome-driven bond, issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)) by channeling coupon amounts to delivering specific outcomes. In this case, the desired outcome is biodiversity performance which is determined based on an increase in the black rhinoceros' populations in target protected areas in South Africa. Black rhinoceroses are categorized as critically endangered species, the next categorization being extinct in the wild, and their shrinking population reflects broader issues in biodiversity and conservation.
This Sustainable Development Bond is issued off the IBRD's Global Debt Issuance Facility. Proceeds from the USD 150 mn bond will be used for the World Bank's sustainable development projects and programs. Instead of paying coupons on the WCB, approximately USD 10 mn, will be paid to two South African protected conservation areas: Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve. The black rhinoceros' populations in both parks represent a meaningful proportion of South Africa's rhinoceroses. Funds paid in lieu of the coupons will be used only for predefined conservation interventions and the rhinoceros population growth rate at each site will be assessed over the period and independently verified. The World Bank will pay investors the bond principal, which is not linked to rhinoceros population growth, as well as a Conservation Success Payment linked to the growth rate in the rhinoceros population funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is the outcome payer in this transaction. This structure transfers the outcome risk to private investors, who stand to gain a contingent success payment dependent upon biodiversity performance, allowing these key stakeholders to participate in biodiversity conservation with capital protection.
From an environmental perspective, it is hoped that the bond will:
Secure the current population of rhinoceroses and encourage further population growth
Protect broader biodiversity and support improvements in planetary health through improved management effectiveness of the ecosystems that rhinos inhabit
Change conservation funding strategies, providing a model of investment for investors looking for a financial return while supporting biodiversity conservation
In addition to the environmental impact, the bond aims to deliver social benefits by catalyzing social-economic development in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, including by creating jobs in a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oliver Withers, Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability at Credit Suisse, said: ""The WCB model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. It will draw in private sector investment into conservation and biodiversity, a pressing environmental concern globally, and we are hopeful that this structure can be replicated across various geographies and for the conservation of various species. We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.""
Michael Bennett, Manager for Market Solutions and Structured Finance, World Bank Treasury, said: ""This outcome-based bond mobilizes much needed private capital for conservation, leveraging the World Banks regular bond issuance platform, triple-A rating, and track record of innovation in capital markets to test a new financing model that links the investment return of a bond to conservation outcomes.""
Jens Welter, Global Co-Head of Banking and Head of Investment Banking Capital Markets for EMEA at Credit Suisse, said: ""We are pleased to have been a part of this innovation in capital markets to help create and distribute an investable debt instrument designed to have a meaningful impact on conserving an endangered species. Importantly, we see the WCB as a steppingstone, one that provides the market with a framework to channel the power and scrutiny of capital markets towards identifying projects and refining strategies to address some of the world's most challenging and pressing environmental and social issues.""
Dr Andrew Terry at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: ""The launch of the Wildlife Conservation Bond – the world's first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species -- is a watershed moment for wildlife conservation. ZSL has spent more than five years working with many outstanding organisations to lay the groundwork for this innovative new financing mechanism that will bring a much-needed injection of new and long-lasting capital into rhino conservation efforts in Africa and help put nature at the heart of financial decision making.""
In addition to being the issuer, IBRD is an implementing agency of the Global Environmental Facility, which is the outcomes payer, providing the grant to pay for outcomes up to the maximum Conservation Success Payment to be paid to investors subject to the Rhino Population Growth Rate. Conservation Alpha Southern Africa is acting as the Rhino Population Growth Rate Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer; it will be working closely with the Verification Agent, ZSL, also appointed by the Issuer, to facilitate the verification process. The scientific and best-practice foundations for the WCB were laid by the Rhino Impact Investment Project, with funding and technical support from key conservation stakeholders including Fauna and Flora International, the IUCN Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group, Oak Foundation, Rufford Foundation, the UK Government through the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the World Wildlife Fund and ZSL.

The attendees include over 2,000 representatives from the global investment community, who will connect virtually with senior executives from some 350 companies with a total market capitalization of over USD8 trillion, to explore what the next 25 years holds in store for the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",Hong Kong,21.03.2022,"Themed “Metamorphosis 25”, the 2022 AIC will provide new insights into how the digitalization of everything from money to retail and a historic shift of capital towards sustainable investments will transform APAC over the next quarter century and beyond – and create opportunities for investors.
Helman Sitohang, CEO, Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, said: “We are proud to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Asian Investment Conference this year. For the past quarter century, the AIC has remained a firm resource for investors to better understand the driving forces behind Asia’s metamorphosis. Credit Suisse’s pivot to APAC is absolutely core to our strategy, and we will be with our valued clients every step of the way to help them find opportunities from the emerging trends shaping this vibrant region.""
The AIC debuted in Hong Kong amid the Asian Financial Crisis after 1997. Since then, APAC has become the powerhouse of global growth. The size of the region’s economy has nearly tripled over the past quarter of a century, up from USD 8.5 trillion in 1997 to over USD 35 trillion in 20211. China rose from the world’s seventh largest economy in 1997 to second today. ASEAN has overtaken the US to become China’s largest trading partner.
While APAC is at the forefront of global innovation and consumption, the region also leads when it comes to investments in renewable energy, with new technologies and a growing commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century promising to transform its economies, enterprises and markets. At the same time, APAC faces demographic shifts with an aging population and is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These forces are driving a metamorphosis with profound implications for investors everywhere.
Over the next four days, more than 90 speakers across 50 keynotes and panel sessions will deliver unique insights into how Asia’s metamorphosis will unfold and the risks and opportunities that lie ahead for the region’s economies.
The speakers at this year’s AIC are renowned thought leaders, government and business leaders, entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize laureates and academics covering a broad spectrum of topics – from the metaverse and sustainable infrastructure to macroeconomic developments such as inflation and monetary policy.

962,Credit Suisse Group update on Russia,Credit Suisse Group today published details on its business exposure in Russia as part of its Annual Report disclosures and outlined its stance with respect to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,Zurich,10.03.2022,"Credit Suisse stands united with the international community in supporting those impacted by this humanitarian crisis.
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, stated: “I speak for the whole Executive Board of Credit Suisse when saying we are deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this invasion and the serious breaches of international law. The instability that these events are creating for societies and countries across the globe will have far-reaching consequences, and our thoughts go out to all those impacted. While we do not have a physical presence in Ukraine, we are committed to providing support to our colleagues and their families within the region. In addition, we have launched a bank-wide appeal in aid of select Red Cross organizations in which Credit Suisse will match the charitable contributions that our employees are making on a one-for-one basis.”
“In purely financial terms, we have reviewed our positions and believe that the bank’s exposure in relation to Russia is well-managed, with appropriate systems in place to address associated risks. The current environment means making difficult decisions and managing through challenging situations, but always with a clear sense of perspective and the desire to do the right thing. As a matter of principle and policy, Credit Suisse applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland.”
Our key exposures are as follows:
Russia net credit exposure was CHF 848 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes derivatives and financing exposures in the Investment Bank, trade finance exposures in the Swiss Universal Bank and Lombard and other loans in International Wealth Management. These net exposures have been reduced since the end of 2021.
Net assets held in our Russian subsidiaries, JSC “Bank Credit Suisse (Moscow)” and LLC “Credit Suisse Securities (Moscow)”, totaled CHF 195 million as of December 31, 2021.
Country credit risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus were not material as of December 31, 2021.
As of March 7, 2022, we had minimal total credit exposures towards specifically sanctioned individuals managed by our Wealth Management division.
Our market risk exposure to Russia as of March 9, 2022 is not significant. Credit Suisse is monitoring settlement risks related to certain open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other factors may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or realize collateral which may result in changes in our exposure. It is premature to estimate the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global economy and markets and on our clients’ risk appetite. However, in the short term, the resultant increase in trading and hedging business activity is expected to be offset by a reduction in capital market issuances due to the rise in volatility as well as by higher credit provisions.
In terms of our physical presence in Russia, Credit Suisse has an office in Moscow with approximately 125 colleagues working across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, in both front office and corporate function roles. Their ongoing safety and security is a top priority; we monitor the situation daily and have planned for a number of potential scenarios.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/03/en/csg-update-russia.html

Documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers by the blind pool nature of the transaction. They contained portfolio statistics and performance modelling related to the underlying balance sheet positions. No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant.""
On March 2, 2022, an international financial news outlet published an article referencing a letter which ""asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans"". This letter relates to a November 2021 synthetic risk transfer transaction, previously reported by the same news outlet, in which engaged parties signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Following the successful closure of the transaction, Credit Suisse requested non-participating investors to destroy documents relating to the matter, as stipulated in the NDA. Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene. The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.

966,Credit Suisse Group Statement,"In response to a consortium of media outlets publishing a series of articles, Credit Suisse Group issued the following statement:",Zurich,20.02.2022,"""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct. While as a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed.
Following numerous inquiries by the consortium over the last three weeks, Credit Suisse has reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control related steps were taken in line with our current framework. We will continue to analyze the matters and take additional steps if necessary.
Credit Suisse notes that the consortium is referring to a large number of external sources including those previously known as well as an alleged leak in their reporting. We take this latter allegation very seriously and will continue with our investigations with an internal task force including specialist external experts. We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients.
As a leading global financial institution, Credit Suisse is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld. These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market¬place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. In line with financial market reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime. Across the bank, Credit Suisse continues to strengthen its compliance and control framework, and as we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/02/en/csg-statement-media.html

968,Credit Suisse Earns Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index,Credit Suisse today announced that it has been recognized for its deep commitment to diversity and inclusion by both the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.,New York,27.01.2022,"Credit Suisse takes great pride in being included for 17 consecutive years in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI), with a score of 100% and earning the designation as a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality."" HRC CEI is the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Credit Suisse earned the maximum number of points in all categories including Workforce Protections, Inclusive Benefits, Supporting an Inclusive Culture & Corporate Social Responsibility, and Responsible Citizenship.
In addition, Credit Suisse has once again been included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year in a row. The GEI is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Those included on this year's index scored at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect disclosure and the achievement or adoption of best-in-class statistics and policies.
Christine Graeff, Group Head Corporate Communications and Deputy Global Head of Human Resources at Credit Suisse said, ""I fundamentally believe in Credit Suisse's obligation and opportunity to be a fair and equitable employer – one that continues to attract, retain and reward highly-talented people across the globe. Our colleagues bring a diversity of perspective and approach, experience and expertise that allow the Bank to innovate and lead for our clients and society more broadly.""
""Our Employer Value Proposition needs to enable a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, underpinned by our systems, processes and the way in which every employee lives our cultural values. We still have work to do and our D&I commitments are a core element of the strategy that will take our Bank forward on a new and positive trajectory,"" Ms. Graeff added.
""Central to our inclusion strategy is ensuring every one of our people feels they belong and are valued – the employee experience is key,"" said Della Sabessar, Global Head of Diversity & Inclusion at Credit Suisse. ""Part of sustaining that culture is ensuring we have the right policies and practices in place to confront any barriers, remove them and create a path to opportunity. This is why the CEI and GEI continue to be important measures of our success. Each year, as they evolve and raise the bar of what companies must achieve to be included in their benchmarks, we are challenged to be better – not just for our women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, but for everyone at Credit Suisse.""",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/credit-suisse-earns-recognition-for-diversity-and-inclusion.html
969,Credit Suisse Group Trading Update,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,25.01.2022,"Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million. These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business. Before deduction of the already announced approximately CHF 1.6 billion goodwill impairment for the Group, of which approximately CHF 1.5 billion in the Investment Bank division and approximately CHF 0.1 billion in the Asia Pacific division, this is expected to result in a reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021.
With regard to our underlying business results, as we indicated in our announcement of November 4, 2021, we have seen a reduction in transaction-based revenues in the Investment Bank and our wealth management businesses. This reflects the usual seasonal slowdown but, in addition, business activity reflects the reversion to more normal trading conditions after the exceptional environment that prevailed for most of 2020 and 2021. Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division (before the goodwill impairment). In our wealth management businesses, there has been a significant slowdown in transaction activity in the International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions, with the latter also reflecting client de-leveraging mainly due to the adverse market conditions in Asia. As a consequence, fourth-quarter 2021 net new assets for our wealth management businesses will be modestly negative, albeit more than offset by inflows in our Asset Management business.
With regard to our capital position, our year-end 2021 Group CET1 ratio is expected to exceed our ambition of 14%, while our year-end 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to exceed 6%.
The financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review. We will provide a full update on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial performance at our results announcement on Thursday, February 10, 2022.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2022/01/en/csg-trading-update.html

979,Credit Suisse finances The Nature Conservancy’s Blue Bond for marine conservation for Belize,,London and New York,05.11.2021,"Credit Suisse and The Nature Conservancy (‘TNC’) announce the completion of the world’s largest Blue Bond for Conservation, allocating capital towards debt sustainability and marine conservation for Belize. 
This is TNC’s inaugural transaction under its Blue Bonds for Conservation program launched in 2019, which raises investment capital for island and coastal nations to restructure a portion of their national debt and create long-term sustainable finance for marine protection, sustainable economic development and addressing climate change.
Credit Suisse acted as sole structurer and arranger of the Blue Bond, raising USD 364 million for TNC pursuant to its Blue Bonds for Conservation program. TNC’s unique Blue Bonds program, and sponsorship of this transaction, creates dedicated funding to help Belize realize its marine conservation efforts, a key factor in the prosperity of the Belizean economy. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance to enable this innovative structure supporting this transaction. The ocean areas and marine ecosystems of Belize account for a significant part of the country’s economy; they are a significant part of the country’s ecotourism and are key to the prosperity of coastal communities in particular.
TNC and the Government of Belize agreed to work together on restructuring the entirety of Belize’s external commercial debt, thereby significantly reducing the country’s existing debt service costs while also securing funding for conservation activities. Proceeds of the Blue Bonds are being used by Belize to repurchase a portion of its USD bonds due 2034, reducing debt service costs and improving long-term debt sustainability. A portion of the financing, USD 23.5 mn, will also be placed into an endowment that will set aside funding for marine conservation accessible from 2041, ultimately aiding in the long-term planning and protection of Belize’s marine ecosystems. As part of the terms of this transaction, approximately USD 4 mn annually, paid in Belize dollars, over the next 20 years will flow to a new, independent conservation fund for Belize, which will disburse funds to marine and coastal conservation projects. In addition, TNC and Belize agreed to numerous conservation commitments and milestones that will help achieve Belize’s conservation goals to the benefit of nature, the Belizean people and the country’s economy.
Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Sustainability Strategy, Advisory & Finance (SSAF) at Credit Suisse, said: “We are delighted to continue our collaboration with The Nature Conservancy whose efforts in environmental conservation are unparalleled. We are proud to have successfully offered TNC our financial and capital markets expertise to support countries as they build more resilient economies, bring benefit to communities and conserve marine ecosystems. This transaction demonstrates Credit Suisse’s commitment to ocean and marine conservation through financial ingenuity.”
Jennifer Morris, Chief Executive Officer at The Nature Conservancy said: “The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and redesigning the ways we invest in our economies and natural assets. The Belize Blue Bond is a world-leading example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to dedicate substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize is showing that when we work together, combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national to the community level, we can achieve enormous wins for people and nature.”
James Howard, Global Head of Investor Products & Hybrids, at Credit Suisse, said: “Our leading global Investor Products franchise is constantly seeking to innovate for our clients and bring unique products to market. We are happy to have delivered this unique Blue Bond financing for Belize, as this transaction represents both innovation in sustainable finance and serves as a blueprint that can be scaled across many other countries. We are confident that transactions using this type of structure will become more frequent in the market, offering countries a way to improve the sustainability of their debt while having a meaningful environmental impact.”
David Marchick, Chief Operating Officer at DFC, said: “DFC is proud to provide political risk insurance to enable this complex and remarkably impactful joint project with TNC and the Government of Belize, along with Credit Suisse. This transaction serves as a model for future partnerships DFC is keen to pursue. This transaction is a win-win-win – it reduces Belize's indebtedness, creates an estimated $180 million stream to invest in marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, and promotes Belize's blue economy. Belize's marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this project will help protect and preserve it for the future.”
As part of this transaction, TNC will work closely with Belize to provide technical assistance to lead the design and establishment of the new conservation fund and facilitate the participatory marine spatial planning process to identify and develop Belize’s new marine protections.

981,Credit Suisse Group announces settlements for legacy issues with regards to Mozambique and resolves the case on past observation activities,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,19.10.2021,"Credit Suisse Group today announced settlements with US, UK and Swiss regulators that resolve inquiries into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and related securities transactions that took place between 2013 and 2016. Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings related to past observation activities. The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.
In terms of loan financing for Mozambique, Credit Suisse Group has entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and consented to the entering of a Cease and Desist Order by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of the DPA, Credit Suisse will continue its compliance enhancement and remediation efforts, report to the DOJ on those efforts for three years, and undertake additional measures, as outlined by the resolutions. In addition, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd. (CSSEL) has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL will be bound by the same obligation as Credit Suisse under the DPA. The total monetary aspect of the DOJ and SEC settlements, taking into account various credits for overlapping penalties, is approximately USD 275 million.
In the resolution with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Credit Suisse agreed that in respect of these transactions with Mozambique between 2013 and 2016, its UK operations had failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Credit Suisse will pay a penalty of approximately USD 200 million, and the bank has also agreed with the FCA to forgive USD 200 million of debt owed by Mozambique.
As a result, the Group expects to take USD 230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021.
In its ruling, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) noted that Credit Suisse violated the duty to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) as the filing in 2019 was considered too late. It also noted that Credit Suisse did not pay enough attention to the risks arising from specific sovereign lending transactions, and has ordered the bank to remediate all deficiencies identified by June 30, 2022. FINMA has imposed a business restriction until an Implementation Auditor has reviewed and approved all measures taken based on the current ruling.
Credit Suisse also noted today’s announcement by FINMA that it has concluded its enforcement proceedings against the bank related to past observation activities. In addition to the known observation of two former Executive Board members, a small group of former executives within the bank planned and mostly executed five further observations of former employees or third parties, all outside Switzerland, between 2016 and 2019. The majority of the additionally conducted observations served to protect the physical safety of employees. The regulator criticized the bank’s decision-making, documentation and supervision of the observations and the lack of internal regulations. The deficiencies in documentation were partially due to the fact that communication took place via external channels that were not authorized by the bank.
As stated previously, Credit Suisse condemns any unjustified observations and has adopted a series of measures, with observations prohibited unless required for compelling reasons such as threats to the physical safety of employees. The bank has already improved its governance and processes in the security area and has also taken steps to enforce the correct usage of electronic communication. FINMA considers these measures in principle suitable to remedy the deficiencies identified and complemented them with limited additional requirements.
The bank also regrets that it initially failed to ensure all relevant information was readily available and hence provided to the regulator in a complete manner.
Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank’s arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises and can now draw a line under the observation matter.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/10/en/finma-mozambique-observation.html

990,Credit Suisse Group publishes the report of the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management,Ad hoc announcement pursuant to article 53 LR,Zurich,29.07.2021,"Credit Suisse Group AG today published the report based on the independent external investigation into Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), which was commissioned by the Board of Directors (Board) and supervised by a special committee of the Board.
Over the past months, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and its expert advisors conducted a comprehensive review of Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos following the US hedge fund’s default on March 25, 2021. The review consisted of more than 80 interviews with current and former Credit Suisse employees as well as the collection of more than 10 million documents and other data.
Among some of the key conclusions, the investigation found a failure to effectively manage risk in the Investment Bank’s Prime Services business by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation. In the same business, it also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures (such as dynamic margining).
However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent. Nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns.
António Horta-Osório, Chairman of Credit Suisse, said: ""While the bank has already taken a series of decisive actions to strengthen the risk framework, we are determined to learn all the right lessons and further enhance our control functions to ensure that we emerge stronger. We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability, where employees are, at heart, risk managers; know exactly what they must do; escalate any concerns; and are responsible for their actions. Such a culture is of critical importance and, by working relentlessly on this goal, we can create lasting change and value for both clients and shareholders.""
Under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee of the Board – which consists of the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the Risk Committee, and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee – and in close collaboration with the Group Chief Executive Officer and selected members of senior management, including the ad interim Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the ad interim Chief Compliance Officer, the new CEO of the Investment Bank Division, and the Head Internal Audit, the bank has already implemented a series of key recommendations (see separate summary of actions taken).
These implementation steps have included several changes in senior leadership at the Investment Bank, including in the Prime Services business, and initiating the recruitment of additional resources for the Risk function. Furthermore, over the past months, a review of all large group-wide exposures and a revision of limit excess controls and escalation requirements has been conducted. A number of risk-governance bodies have been reviewed and upgraded, and a reduced risk appetite across the organization has been implemented together with additional approval requirements for all material transactions. Through this exercise, the bank has significantly reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Prime Services business while increasing margin requirements, and all hedge fund clients have been moved to dynamic margining. In addition, the bank has commissioned a review of double-hatted roles.
A key aspect of the overall review considered individual accountability, with subsequent actions taken on 23 individuals. These actions include termination of employment (nine individuals) and severe monetary penalties totaling approximately USD 70 mn in the aggregate via compensation adjustment tools encompassing up to 100% malus (the cancellation of outstanding deferred awards) and some clawback (the recovery of previously paid amounts). The bank will provide a full accounting of the implicit and explicit compensation consequences for the Archegos incident in the Compensation Report after the close of the year.
Finally, earlier this week, the bank announced the appointment of David Wildermuth as the new CRO, joining from Goldman Sachs and bringing a wealth of relevant risk management experience with him. He will commence his new role in early 2022. Until then, and as originally planned and announced in early April 2021, Joachim Oechslin, will continue as ad interim CRO. Joachim Oechslin and Richard Meddings, the ad interim Chair of the Risk Committee, have both been instrumental in leading and implementing the above described risk management improvement steps.
Credit Suisse is committed to working relentlessly toward establishing a culture of clear accountability and responsibility, while continuing our in-depth read-across to ensure this never happens again, and to creating sustainable value for both clients and shareholders.

998,Global Wealth Report 2021,Credit Suisse Research Institute published its twelfth Global Wealth Report showing continued wealth growth,London,22.06.2021,"Wealth creation in 2020 was largely immune to the challenges facing the world due to the actions taken by governments and central banks to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Total global wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult rose by 6% to reach another record high of USD 79,952. Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in terms of wealth creation.
The pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020. The report estimates that USD 17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March 2020, equivalent to a fall of 4.4%. This was largely reversed by the end of June. Surprisingly, in the second half of 2020 share prices continued on an upward path, reaching record levels by the end of the year. Housing markets also benefitted from the prevailing optimism as house prices rose at rates not seen for many years. The net result was that USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year.
Key highlights
Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 28.7 trillion to reach USD 418.3 trillion at the end of the year. In terms of current US dollars, total wealth grew by 7.4% and wealth per adult was up 6.0%. However, widespread depreciation of the US dollar accounted for 3.3 percentage points of the growth. If exchange rates had remained the same as in 2019, total wealth would have grown by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%.
The regional breakdown shows that total wealth rose by USD 12.4 trillion in North America and by USD 9.2 trillion in Europe. These two regions accounted for the bulk of the wealth gains in 2020, with China adding another USD 4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) another USD 4.7 trillion.
India and Latin America both recorded losses in 2020. Total wealth fell in India by USD 594 billion, or 4.4% in percentage terms. This loss was amplified by exchange rate depreciation: at fixed exchange rates, the loss would have been 2.1%. Latin America appears to have been the worst performing region, with total wealth dropping by 11.4% or USD 1.2 trillion.
Total debts increased by 7.5% and would likely have increased much more if households had not been obliged to save more by the constraints on spending. Total debt rose markedly in China and Europe, but declined in Africa and in Latin America, even after allowance is made for exchange rate depreciation.
Windfalls from unplanned savings and prevailing low interest rates saw a revival in housing markets during the second half of 2020. The net result was a better-than-average year for homeowners in most countries.
Global wealth levels 2020
Wealth impacts of the pandemic have differed among population subgroups due to two main factors: portfolio composition and income shocks. The wealth of those with a higher share of equities among their assets, e.g. late middle age individuals, men, and wealthier groups in general, tended to fare better. Homeowners in most markets have seen capital gains due to rising house prices.
There have been large differences in income shocks during the pandemic. In many high-income countries the loss of labor or business income was softened by emergency benefits and employment policies. In countries with an absence of income support, vulnerable groups like women, minorities and young people were particularly affected.
Female workers initially suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, partly because of their high representation in businesses and industries badly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, personal service and retail. Labor force participation declined over the course of 2020 for both men and women, but the size of the decline was similar, at least in most advanced economies.
Wealth distribution 2020
Wealth differences between adults widened in 2020. The global number of millionaires expanded by 5.2 million to reach 56.1 million. As a result, an adult now needs more than USD 1 million to belong to the global top 1%. A year ago, the requirement for a top 1% membership was USD 988,103. So, 2020 marks the year when for the first time, more than one percent of all global adults are in nominal terms dollar millionaires. The ultra high net worth (UHNW) group grew even faster, adding 24% more members, the highest rate of increase since 2003. Since 2000, people with wealth in the range of USD 10,000–100,000, have seen the biggest rise in numbers, more than trebling in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. This reflects the growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world.
Wealth outlook 2020-25
Global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years, reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Low and middle-income countries are responsible for 42% of the growth, although they account for just 33% of current wealth. Wealth per adult is projected to increase by 31%, passing the mark of USD 100,000. Unadjusted for inflation, the number of millionaires will also grow markedly over the next five years reaching 84 million, while the number of UHNWIs should reach 344,000.
Anthony Shorrocks, economist and report author, said: “The pandemic had an acute short term impact on global markets but this was largely reversed by the end of June 2020. As we noted last year, global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year. Indeed wealth creation in 2020 appears to have been completely detached from the economic woes resulting from COVID-19. If asset price increases are set aside, then global household wealth may well have fallen. In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed. Some of the underlying factors may self-correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.”
Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Chief Investment Officer International Wealth Management and Global Head of Economics & Research at Credit Suisse, said: “There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organize massive income transfer programs to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.
“Although successful, these interventions have come at a great cost. Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries. Coupled with restricted consumption, household saving has surged inflating household financial assets and lowering debts. The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.”

1000,Credit Suisse research shows global food inequality and waste costs up to US$13.6 trillion annually,,London,08.06.2021,"Credit Suisse Research Institute (CSRI) published a new research report entitled ‘The global food system: Identifying sustainable solutions’, the first under new Chairman António Horta-Osório. The report examines the discrepancy in food production and waste and highlights potential solutions to reduce the estimated US$13.6 trillion annual cost.
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the global eco-system. However, at present almost 700 million people are undernourished while 40% of the world’s adult population is overweight or obese. Some studies suggest that 20% of total deaths among adults can be attributed to dietary risks. Food production, and importantly consumption, needs to change significantly in order to address these challenges. Roadblocks that need to be overcome include the need for tighter regulation and a review of the global agricultural sector.
Food production and consumption has a major environmental impact
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% of the world’s freshwater consumption (see also: Water scarcity: addressing the key challenges). The analysis suggest that the environmental footprint of the global food system is likely to worsen significantly during the next few decades unless action is taken. The likely growth in the world’s population to c10 billion by 2050 coupled with a further shift in diets, especially across the expanding emerging middle class, could increase food-related emissions by a further 46% while demand for agricultural land could increase by 49%. This is incompatible with the need to achieve a net-zero emission environment globally by 2050.
Food loss and waste needs to be addressed
The challenges associated with malnutrition and the environmental footprint could partly be addressed by targeting food loss and waste. More than 30% of food produced is either lost or wasted which meant that in 2019 cUS$408 billion of produced food went unsold or uneaten. The combined economic, environmental and social cost associated with food waste is estimated at US$2.6 trillion by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Eliminating food waste in the US and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as c50% of food loss and waste occurs during the production and handling phase while 45% takes place in the distribution and consumption phase.
Who’s most at risk from food sustainability?
The simultaneous existence of undernourishment, obesity, the environmental footprint of food production and food waste puts the global food system under significant stress. However, these factors do not impact all countries in the same way suggesting that different solutions or strategies are needed for different countries. Using the Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, we find that France, the Netherlands and Canada score best while sustainability is lowest in Russia, Bulgaria and the UAE. Sustainability challenges differ between regions: developed countries score worse on diet patterns and food waste whereas emerging countries need to address food loss and general life quality.
A change in diet is required
A change in diet towards one that is plant-based appears inevitable if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research suggest that a plant-based diet not only has a c90% lower emission intensity than that of a current average diet but that it also has the potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults by c11million. There is strong growth potential for alternative animal-protein products and the report estimates that the market for alternative meat and dairy can grow from a current size of cUS$14 billion to US$1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite the involvement of more than 600 largely small and private companies in this field, the authors expect the traditional food companies to play a key role as they steadily transition their operations towards healthier and alternative food products.
Agriculture needs to go digital
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending power and declining arable land per capita suggest that a shift in diet alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large scale adoption of new technologies. The report highlights more than 70 including vertical farming and precision agricultural solutions.
Sharing, circular-solutions, packaging and cooling help address food loss and waste
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste to create new (food) products help too. Smart packaging solutions are being developed that not only help improve production yields but importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply chain from farm to the home. The development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food even more.
Eugène Klerk, Head of Global ESG & Thematic Research at Credit Suisse, said: “New technologies will need to accompany behavioral change. A shift in diet alone will not be enough in itself to make the food system wholly sustainable. Our report thus highlights an array of technological solutions that have the potential to improve productivity, expand the product offer and crucially reduce waste. In addition, it showcases innovative companies and their pioneering technologies designed to meet the challenge.”
Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer at Credit Suisse, commented: “Sustainability is a risk that companies must adequately and proactively manage. And, as other sectors before it, the food industry is going to be increasingly scrutinized by investors, consumers and regulators, pushing it to focus more on sustainable and above all, healthy food. There could be material liability risks down the road otherwise. There are also likely beneficiaries from this transition, including technology companies providing “smart-agricultural” solutions, vertical and precision farming to meet urban food demand and provide productivity yields, companies who use circular-based or smart-packaging solutions and the development and introduction of cooling and storage solutions that help extend the lifespan of food even more. But ultimately, it is really about people living a longer and more healthy life altogether, and I am convinced that investors play a significant role in catalyzing these emerging trends in how they deploy their capital.”",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/06/en/credit-suisse-research-shows-global-food-inequality-and-waste-co.html
1001,Credit Suisse Americas Foundation Makes a Commitment to Wake Tech,"Raleigh, NC, May 26, 2021 – Credit Suisse, one of the world's leading financial services providers, has announced a $250,000 commitment through its Credit Suisse Americas Foundation (CSAF) to support Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech).",New York,26.05.2021,"Wake Tech is the largest community college in North Carolina. It serves more than 70,000 adults each year across six campuses and three training centers, in addition to community sites and online learning options.

1002,Credit Suisse sees strong future for domestic Chinese consumer brands,"The policy of ""Dual Circulation"", which will guide China's economic development for years to come, has driven an upsurge in domestic demand for Chinese consumer brands, according to Credit Suisse Securities Research analysts presenting at the 8th annual China A- Shares Conference.",Hong Kong,25.05.2021,"The Credit Suisse 8th China A-Shares Conference, taking place online from May 11-13, 2021, provides a platform for investors to explore the emerging trends in one of the world's largest and most dynamic stock markets. Participating in this year's conference are more than 70 leading A-share listed companies spanning 12 sectors including technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, industrials and autos and representing a total market capitalization of over RMB 9,147bn (USD 1,412.8bn).
Edmond Huang, Head of China/Hong Kong Securities Research, Credit Suisse, described ""Dual Circulation"" as a strategic choice to rebalance the Chinese economy away from an overreliance on external demand, provide a catalyst for unleashing domestic demand and achieve more sustainable development.
""On the supply side, China will step up technological innovation to move along the global value chain. On the demand side, it aims to boost household incomes to stimulate domestic demand,"" Mr. Huang said.
The global pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions have been two principal drivers of the ""Dual Circulation"" strategy, an inversion of China's previous strategy of globalization and trade-led growth.
The contribution to the Chinese economy from net exports is no longer as significant as it was 20 years ago, while the ageing population and growing wallets of Chinese consumers have also been a significant contributor to this new economic development model.
""Chinese brands have made remarkable progress in upgrading the quality of their products, with better aesthetics, innovation, and technology enhancements contributing to their overall enhanced appeal. They also have advantages in being able to adapt their products faster to changing consumer sentiment,"" Mr. Huang added.
This has, in turn, driven a strong sense of national pride in Chinese brands from domestic consumers. The phenomenon, known as ""China Pride"", is manifesting itself particularly for products such as sportswear, cosmetics, mobile phones and electric vehicles.
""Confidence in Chinese brands has been slowly growing for a number of years, but it accelerated through the pandemic,"" said Lei Chen, China consumer analyst with Credit Suisse's China Quantitative Insight (CQi). ""The improved product quality, marketing and distribution strategy, in addition to an increasing skepticism towards imported goods, especially foodstuffs, during Covid, have contributed to the rise of homegrown labels in China,"" Ms. Chen continued.
While the ""China Pride"" phenomenon is more pronounced among a younger generation that is largely wealthier than their parents were at the same stage in their lives, those younger consumers are also making luxury purchases earlier. This is one of the reasons why Credit Suisse analysts view this phenomenon as a long term trend for investors.
""Younger consumers are spending money earlier and are a key aspect of this ""China Pride"" idea that will become increasingly more meaningful as they mature into the next generation of older shoppers,"" Ms. Chen said.
Credit Suisse analysts expect those sectors hit hardest by Covid-19 in 2020, such travel, entertainment, cinemas and restaurants, to make a resurgence. In particular, the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 will boost sportswear and ""health conscious"" spending. But in general, Credit Suisse's analysts see this highly identifiable phenomenon of ""China Pride"" across the board – in infant formula, cosmetics and technology items, as well as in areas such as new energy vehicles and automobiles.
Sectors to watch
In the auto sector, China is expected to reduce its reliance on imported goods such as high-end luxury cars, pushing Chinese auto makers to establish high-end domestic auto brands that leverage the country's leadership in new energy and intelligent vehicle technologies, according to Bin Wang, Co- Head of APAC Autos Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
China's dominant position in electric vehicles is gathering pace, fomented by a rapidly evolving support sector. Battery prices continue to decline. Concurrently, the infrastructure to support electric vehicles, such as charging stations, are proliferating, while the rise of new entrants creates greater choices at different price points for domestic consumers.
""For the first quarter of 2021, Chinese local brands' new energy vehicles (NEV) accounted for 75.5% of total China NEV sales volume, reflecting consumer preference for Chinese branded vehicles,"" Mr. Wang said.
In the consumer sector, strong digital and marketing capabilities as well as a nimbleness to respond to consumers' changing needs, have led to strong momentum for domestic brands in sportswear, color cosmetics, skincare and infant milk formula, which have the potential to further increase market share.
Another factor contributing to ""China Pride"" as a long-term investment trend is that despite strong growth in the aforementioned sectors, Chinese brands are still underpenetrated when compared with the overall size of the market, with room for upside, according to Jesalyn Wong, China Consumer Analyst, Securities Research, Credit Suisse.
Strong and broad research coverage capabilities
Credit Suisse has one of the most comprehensive and highly recognized China Research coverage capabilities. The Credit Suisse Equity Research team covers more than 460 Chinese-listed stocks, including about 216 domestic A-shares, which represent over 70% of the CSI-300 index constituents by market capitalization.

The grant will support Braven's New York City operations, which launched last year.",New York,04.05.2021,"Braven's mission is to empower promising, underrepresented young people – first-generation college students, students from low-income backgrounds, and students of color – with the skills, confidence, experiences and networks necessary to transition from college to strong first jobs which lead to meaningful careers and lives of impact. At the universities and colleges which partner with Braven, Fellows earn course credit while gaining valuable insights and experiences that are designed to accelerate job attainment within 6 months of graduation. After seeing positive results in three other US markets, Braven launched in New York in the Spring of 2020 in partnership with the City University of New York and Lehman College, undeterred by the challenges of doing so in a virtual landscape. To date, Braven has served nearly 400 students and is on a path to serve more than 1,800 students within four years.
This investment is part of Credit Suisse's philanthropic commitment to Future Skills, which aims to equip young people with the skills and education needed to gain meaningful employment and fulfill their potential. This donation continues a multi-decade commitment by the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation to empower underrepresented young people. Through this and other partnerships, Credit Suisse upholds our responsibility to be more intentional about advancing diversity, equity and inclusion, internally and externally, by leveraging our platform and resources.
""We're both proud and thrilled to partner with Braven,"" said Eric Eckholdt, Executive Director of the Credit Suisse Americas Foundation and Head of Corporate Citizenship Americas. ""The organization embodies what we think is critical to building a more inclusive society – a deeper cooperation between employers and the education system so that all have pathways to careers that provide for self-sufficient, choice-filled lives. Along with their bold and innovative mission, we admire Braven's spirit, leadership and ability to bring together the many stakeholders who make this possible. It's an honor to support them, especially at this critical time during their expansion in NYC.""

Credit Suisse Group AG today announces that it has determined the conversion ratio and conversion price for the two series of mandatory convertible notes (“MCNs”), the Series A MCNs and the Series B MCNs, whose placement was announced on April 22, 2021 in a separate press release (the “April 22 Release”) as well as the subscription ratio applicable to the preferential subscription rights (“Rights”) further described in the April 22 Release to be granted to shareholders of Credit Suisse Group AG in relation to the Series B MCNs.
The MCNs’ conversion ratio has been determined to be 23,121.38728 shares per CHF 200,000 principal amount in respect of the Series A MCNs and 115.60694 shares per CHF 1,000 principal amount in respect of the Series B MCNs, which in each case is equal to the CHF-denominated principal amount of one MCN of the relevant series divided by the conversion price, which has been determined to be CHF 8.65 in respect of each series. As discussed in the April 22 Release, the conversion price represents the average of the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of Credit Suisse Group AG’s shares on April 22 and 23, 2021, less a discount of 5.0%. As a result of such determinations, the aggregate principal amount of Series A MCNs to be issued will be CHF 865 million and the aggregate principal amount of Series B MCNs to be issued will be CHF 891 million.
As discussed in the April 22 Release, for the Series B MCNs, Credit Suisse Group AG shareholders will be granted one Right for each registered share held after close of trading on April 27, 2021. The subscription ratio (that is, the number of Rights necessary to subscribe to one (1) Series B MCN of CHF 1,000 principal amount at the issue price of 100%) has been determined to be 2,713 Rights.

Credit Suisse Group AG today announces that it has placed two series of mandatory convertible notes (“MCNs”), Series A MCNs and Series B MCNs, which will be convertible into 100 million shares and 103 million shares of Credit Suisse Group AG, respectively (together “the Offering”). Both series were placed to a selected group of core shareholders, institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.
The Series A MCNs have already been placed and allocated directly with such investors.
The Series B MCNs were pre-placed to such investors but are being re-offered to existing shareholders of Credit Suisse Group AG by way of an offering of preferential subscription rights (“Rights”).
The investors have entered into definitive agreements to purchase any Series B MCNs not taken up by shareholders, thereby ensuring full placement of both series of MCNs.
As discussed in our earnings release published today, our capital position remained solid with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% and a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.8% as per the end of 1Q21. However, with the Offering, we expect to further strengthen our capital position in line with our intention to achieve a CET1 ratio of approximately 13% and a minimum CET1 leverage ratio of 4%.
The MCNs will be issued by Credit Suisse Group (Guernsey) VII, Limited (the “Issuer”) on or around May 12, 2021, and will benefit from an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by Credit Suisse Group AG of amounts due under them and, on a subordinated basis, the delivery of shares on their conversion. The MCNs will be mandatorily convertible at their 6 month maturity (but subject to early conversion upon the occurrence of certain events, as well as at the option of the holder after an initial 40-day period).
The MCNs’ conversion ratio will be their CHF-denominated principal amount divided by their conversion price, which will be set at an at-the-market discount of 5.0% to the average of the volume-weighted average price of Credit Suisse Group AG’s shares on April 22 and 23, 2021. Unless converted early at the option of the holder, the Issuer will pay a fixed interest amount on the MCNs at the time of their conversion equivalent to a rate of 3.0% per annum. The Issuer will also pay a floating interest amount on the MCNs to the extent any cash dividend or cash distribution is made by Credit Suisse Group AG to its shareholders after the pricing date but prior to the relevant conversion date.
For the series B MCNs, Credit Suisse Group AG shareholders will be granted one Right for each registered share held after close of trading on April 27, 2021. The Rights will, subject to certain limitations based on residency, be exercisable from April 28, 2021 until May 6, 2021 at 12.00 noon (CEST).
The shares of Credit Suisse Group AG underlying the Series A MCNs will be issued from Credit Suisse Group AG's current conditional capital. The shares of Credit Suisse Group AG underlying the Series B MCNs will be issued from Credit Suisse Group AG's current authorized capital. As the full amount of the current authorized capital is expected to be utilized for such issuance, the Board has decided to withdraw, at the Annual General Meeting 2021, its proposal for a moderate increase and the extension of the authorized capital.

1012,Credit Suisse Asset Management update on Supply Chain Finance Funds; next distribution to investors of USD 1.7 billion,"Since the four Supply Chain Finance Funds (SCFFs) were suspended on March 1, 2021, we have made progress on the wind-down of the funds.",Zurich,13.04.2021,"As at April 9, 2021 we have collected USD 2.0 billion from receivables redeemed since March 1, 2021. This results in cash and cash equivalent levels currently in the SCFFs amounting to USD 2.3 billion. The total cash position, including the USD 3.1 billion that already has been distributed to investors, thus amounts to USD 5.4 billion, or more than half of the total Assets under Management of the four funds at the time of their suspension. We are therefore able to announce a second cash distribution to investors, amounting to USD 1.7 billion, commencing today. This takes the total distribution so far to USD 4.8 billion.
Credit Suisse Asset Management continues to work on identifying and progressing options to secure recovery. Liquidation proceeds will be paid out to investors as soon as feasible in one or more instalments until the investors receive the funds’ total collected net liquidation proceeds. Investors will receive notification of such payments.
Credit Suisse Asset Management is in active dialogue with the Joint Administrators of Greensill Capital (UK) Ltd, Grant Thornton, and, where appropriate, is engaging directly with potentially delinquent obligors and other creditors. Claims will also be made under relevant insurance policies where there is evidence of non-payment or default. It is important to note that in many of these cases of non-payment or default, the obligors are firms with tangible assets. The current assessment is that there is potential for recovery in these cases although clearly there is a considerable degree of uncertainty as to the amounts that ultimately will be distributed to investors in respect of the funds. We will continue to report on the progress we are making with these situations as appropriate.
Furthermore, Credit Suisse Asset Management will consider appropriate legal actions to protect fund holders’ interests.
Outlook
We remain acutely aware of the uncertainty that the wind-down process creates for those of our clients who are invested in the funds. We are doing everything that we can to provide them with clarity, to work through issues as they arise and, ultimately, to return cash to them. We intend to provide a further update on the progress made by the end of April 2021.",https://www.credit-suisse.com/articles/media-releases/2021/04/en/csam-supply-chain-finance-funds.html

1014,Trading Update,,Zurich,06.04.2021,"While our financial results are still subject to detailed finalization and review, we would expect to report a pre-tax loss for 1Q 2021 of approximately CHF 900 million. This includes a charge of CHF 4.4 billion in respect of the failure by a US-based hedge fund to meet its margin commitments as we announced on March 29, 2021. This will negate the very strong performance that had otherwise been achieved by our investment banking businesses and the increase in the year-on-year profits in all three of our wealth management businesses, as well as in asset management, with particular strength in our Asia Pacific division. Net new assets were positive during the quarter across our three wealth management businesses as well as in asset management and in the Swiss corporate and institutional business. 
In terms of our capital position, while this is also still subject to our usual end-period finalization and review processes, we would currently expect the 1Q 2021 CET1 ratio to be at least 12%. With regard to leverage, we expect our 1Q 2021 Tier 1 leverage ratio to be at least 5.4% and our 1Q 2021 CET1 leverage ratio to be at least 3.7%. Following the completion of share buybacks in 1Q 2021, we have suspended the share buyback program and we do not intend to resume share purchases before we have regained our target capital ratios and restored our dividend. As of the end of 1Q21, our liquidity position remains strong with HQLA balances expected to exceed USD 200 billion and the Group liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) expected to exceed 200%.
With regard to the four supply chain finance funds, where we continue to see cash inflows, we will distribute a separate update on further repayments within the next few days.
We acknowledge that both the US hedge fund and the supply chain finance fund matters require substantial further review and scrutiny. The Board of Directors has launched investigations into both of these matters which will not only focus on the direct issues arising from each of them, but also reflect on the broader consequences and lessons learned. We have also undertaken senior management changes within the Investment Bank division and within the Risk and Compliance organization as separately announced today. 
Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse Group said: ""The significant loss in our Prime Services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable. In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders. Together with the Board of Directors, we are fully committed to addressing these situations. Serious lessons will be learned. Credit Suisse remains a formidable institution with a rich history.""

Further Actions by the Board of Directors
In March 2021, the tactical crisis committee of the Board of Directors consisting of the Chairman, the Chairs of the Audit Committee and Risk Committee and the Chair of the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee was activated to exercise close oversight and ensure timely decision making with respect to the resolution of the issues in connection with the Credit Suisse Asset Management managed supply chain finance funds. The mandate of this committee has in the meanwhile been expanded to include the significant US-based hedge fund matter. The tactical crisis committee works closely with the CEO and the rest of the management team.
The Board of Directors has launched two investigations, to be carried out by external parties, into the supply chain finance funds matter and into the significant US-based hedge fund matter.
